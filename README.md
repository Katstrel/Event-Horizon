# [The Event Horizon](https://archiveofourown.org/series/4282051)

***There is no going back.***

Every second lived is another horizon crossed.  
Every breath taken is another decision to exist.  
Every choice made has consequences.  

Accretion is the gradual growth, how it all began.  
Shooting Stars are only just the beginning, a new start.   
Aphelion...  

## Getting Started
So you're interested in styling your own works on AO3? That's exactly why I share the actual html files I fix up before posting my work. Feel free to look at how I did certain effects.

Some of my comments are far from the actual terminology since I wasn't taught HTML and CSS but picked it up while wanting to create my own workskins and siteskins for AO3. I'm just trying to convey the idea of what's happening rather than any textbook terms.

Look at template.html and workskin.css for comments. The actual work html files rarely, if ever, have comments. Use those to figure out how I applied CSS within my chapters.

### Resources
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is the code editor I use.  
[HTML CSS Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ecmel.vscode-html-css) provides the ability to tab complete elements from the CSS stylesheet (workskin).  
[Live Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server) allows for previewing the html document within the editor.  
[CSS Guides](https://archiveofourown.org/series/4168489) has a lot of cool effects to look into.
