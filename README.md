# The Event Horizon
https://archiveofourown.org/series/4282051

## Summary
***There is no going back.***

Every second lived is another horizon crossed.  
Every breath taken is another decision to exist.  
Every choice made has consequences.  

Accretion is the gradual growth, how it all began.  
Shooting Stars are only just the beginning, a new start.   
Equinox...  


## Author's Notes
These are almost all the files I used and worked on while writing the Event Horizon series on Archive of Our Own. I thought it would be fun to show all the the background things and everything possibly thrown out while making the story. Feel free to browse through it all or just see the gradual growth I had while writing.

Before even starting to incorporate git in my workflow I had used:
- Notion
- Half Notion, Half Google Docs
- Google Docs
- VSCode for ensuring format was correct before posting
- VSCode with git and GitHub

I'll probably try swapping fully to using the repository when I have a real laptop since I like sitting in different places while I write. My desktop is great though.

## Ideas
So quick disclaimer that not all ideas are implemented in-universe as is written here. Some will have very similar to what was actually written because the notes here were just the draft form.

## Inspirations
Gotta admit, there are a lot of small ideas I know I must have stolen from other fics but I can not recall which ones!

Although, I do admit that some writers were huge inspirations. If you haven't read anything from GentryChild go do so! If I remember correctly I might have stolen the Blink quirk from them. I just loved the idea so much.
