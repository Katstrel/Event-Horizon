# (α) Alpha Terminology
Alpha Ability (Quirk) — Scientific name of meta abilities or quirks  
Alpha Element (Quirk Factor) — Pieces of DNA that seem to carry instructions for alpha abilities.  
Plus Alpha Element — Physical manifestation for ability use  
Minus Alpha Element — Physical drawback to an ability, usually harmful  

Alpha Energy (Alpha Potency) — Metaphysical force used to warp the world within the body  
Alpha Waves — Produced by the brain when relaxed and idle, found during meditation or waking up. Brain waves.

## Conditions of Alpha Ability
(Δ) Delta Event (Factoring) — The alpha elements within the body are called upon by the core to create or modify plus or minus alpha elements  
(ζ) Zeta Event (Division) — When a factoring weakens the existing ability or creates more minus alpha elements that it should have  
(ε) Epsilon Event — when a factoring occurred but failed to create or modify plus or minus alpha elements

Manifest — The first factoring within an organism  
Awaken — An already manifested alpha ability undergoes factoring

## Thoughts
We are constantly bombarded by external dna by microbes, pollen, and food.

There are three main components to quirks. Genetics, plus alpha, and quirk factor. Genetics are the blueprint for the plus alpha and quirk factor. Plus alpha is a link to a different plane of existence, the spirit plane. It's a link or a lens more than anything. Plus alpha energy is not directly someone’s spirit but an extension or focus of it. Quirk factor is the physical manifestation within the body for the plus alpha energy to channel through. Injuring someone’s quirk factor can limit their ability to use their quirk.

### A quick discussion of copy quirks and the Plus Alpha
Copy quirks merely copy the non physical ‘lens’ of Plus Alpha, giving themselves a link to the target’s spirit. This link allows them to use their own energy to channel the target’s energy and manifest the needed quirk factor to unleash the energy accessible through the target ‘lens’. Although, if the energy needs a physical fuel source, most copy quirks do not copy the fuel. The created copy of a ‘lens’ is always a little smaller or weaker than the target ‘lens’. If two copy quirk users were to keep copying a single quirk off of each other, the ‘lens’ would eventually be too small to even activate any effects. Finally, the created copy ‘lens’ can never be larger or more powerful than the copy quirk’s ‘lens’.

### What about multi-quirked users?
The copy user may feel the ‘lens’ of every quirk available to the target and may have to choose a single ‘lens’ to target. This completely ignores canon with Monoma and Midoriya but with these rules Monoma would be able to tell Midoriya has more than one quirk after Blackwhip manifested. He would even have been able to copy Blackwhip and use a weaker version of it. Although, a copy of One for All would be missing the stockpiled strength.
