# Izuku & Katsuki

Mikumo takes Bakugou's quirk for a week



### Katsuki figuring out Mikumo
Katsuki figures out that Mikumo is Izuku.  
Mikumo is in a memory. Calls Katsuki, Kacchan  
Katsuki fully sees it, this is Izuku.  
“Izuku, hey, calm down.”  
The man responds to the name, holy fuck.  
Later, “So, Izuku, what happened to you?”  
Mikumo startles, smiles, “So much that will never happen to Midoriya.”  
“Will he have your bullshit quirk?”  
“I guess if he wants it and understands the burden it carries. I was still born quirkless, you know. This quirk wasn’t originally mine, but I’ve made it mine… What else could I do?”
