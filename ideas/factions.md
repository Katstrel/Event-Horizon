# Factions
## Shie Hassaikai
Overhaul could instead be complex, a business partner. He sees quirks as a disease.  
Mikumo would meet him when talking with the old man  
Kai shows his dislike for his quirk. His brain tells him everything he’s touching. Aware of every single microbe touching his hands.  
Mikumo had already started taking from those who ask, he asks what Kai wants.  
The one interaction shifts the course of Kai and Eri’s life.  
Shie Hassaikai is a close ally of Acheron that day forward.  

## Meta Liberation Army
The Meta Liberation Army actually stands against Acheron.  
The ability to take their abilities away scares them.   
To be made quirkless is to be useless within society, to have no purpose or power  
The quirkless are not hated but are seen as sub human, some subgroups hate them  
Re-Destro hadn’t known the myth of All for One was real and still lived.   
All for One had helped crush the MLA, maybe  
It’s more of Mikumo doesn’t get along with their methods and views of quirkless  
He does advocate for looser restrictions on quirks  

## Hero Public Safety Commission
HPSC has the Paragon program, training and owning heroes  
Mikumo is concerned over the slavery, the forced child soldiers.  
In the old timeline, hadn’t they forced first years to fight?  
He finds research on DNA manipulation, like Garaki’s. Oh shit.  
Nedzu came from one of the unmarked facilities. Multiple quirks.  
- Immortality, tea requirement  
- High Specs, process info  
- Photo-memory  

## Ultra Academy High School
Nedzu is against the HPSC but understands that his position at UA doesn’t allow him to outright oppose them.
Mikumo and him are introduced when Shouta takes the job.
UA and Acheron are allies even if the subordinates don’t know that.
After all, who is Akatani Mikumo? Just a simple man running a quirk office.
