            <strong>Friday, April 15, 2146</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            Tiredness hung onto him like a weighted blanket. His legs wanted
            to buckle underneath him. His head pounded in time with his
            heartbeat. Thankfully, his nosebleed had stopped flowing. He was
            covered in dirt, dust, and blood.
        </p>

        <p>
            His right arm hurt from the first time he used
            <em>Laser</em> and from helping Amajiki power his Plasma Cannon
            move with the quirk afterward. Blood slowly trickled down from
            the gash it had caused near his shoulder from the first use,
            even as <em>Regeneration</em> worked to reverse the damage.
        </p>

        <p>
            The blast of the cannon had damaged All for One much more than
            he thought it would. <em>Good</em>. He just had to lure the
            demon into staying within Amajiki&rsquo;s line of fire. Well,
            that was nothing a little bit of psychic damage
            couldn&rsquo;t fix.
        </p>

        <p>
            When he had lived in the laboratory, Doctor Garaki had
            accidentally introduced him to these things called memes and
            vines from when the ancient man had been in his youth. They were
            fun and had exacerbated his old master when he was around. Using
            them also seemed to piss off All for One during this fight as
            well. Mikumo smirked as he initiated the Circle Game, something
            that had likely died over a century ago.
        </p>

        <p>
            All for One rounded on him in an instant, pure fury made his
            white eyes almost tinge with red. Bloodlust had been a constant
            in this fight, but now it was so oppressive he couldn't move.
            Maybe he had miscalculated how much he was messing with the
            Demon King.
        </p>

        <p>
            Jagged fingers made of red and black extended outward from the
            man&rsquo;s hand and pierced through Mikumo&rsquo;s chest and
            abdomen as he locked eyes with All for One. Diamond star shaped
            pupils stared each other down. The man smiled with all teeth
            before uttering,
            <em>&ldquo;Disappear.&rdquo;</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            Pain encompassed his entire being. A raw scream tore from his
            throat. It was excruciating. Golden light swirled around him in
            wisps as white particles seemed to flake off him into the air.
            Static crackled as lightning seemed to join in, shattering the
            surrounding space. A deafening explosion and thunder rolled. The
            ruins of Tatooin Station disappeared in blinding white that fell
            away to black.
        </p>

        <p>
            Within a void, he saw countless stars in the sky. Colors of
            every hue floated around him on all sides. They bunched up into
            galaxies surrounding supermassive black holes. Wait, no, those
            were
            <em>white</em>. Supermassive white holes. Forever flinging light
            and mass into space, likely fueling the creation of the galaxies
            rotating around them.
        </p>

        <p>
            Golden light continued to twist in the air, crackling, and
            flaking like stardust off of him. He was just another star in
            the sky. He was floating along with them. He was so tired. It
            sounded like a dream to rest peacefully amongst the stars,
            another constellation added to the night sky.
        </p>

        <p>
            It was so tempting to close his eyes. So tempting to give in and
            fade away from this Inbetween. This wasn&rsquo;t a dream. This
            wasn&rsquo;t any mindscape. It all felt so real. He knew in his
            soul this was real. His body pleaded for rest, while instinct
            screamed to stay awake.
        </p>

        <p>
            Ignoring the desire to rest, green eyes opened after only a
            moment, a second or hours, of drifting in the void amongst the
            stars. He continued to glow a brilliant gold and white, although
            it felt like there was more white than before. Although, he
            realized he wasn&rsquo;t just floating along with the stars. No,
            he&hellip;

            Thunder rolled in his ears once more, and Mikumo opened his
            eyes. The bright blue midday sky stared back at him. Fluffy
            white clouds dotted the sky and trailed along in the breeze
            lazily. Rather than the expected sounds of explosions and
            pressure shockwaves, people talking and cars honking greeted his
            ears.
        </p>

        <p><em>What?</em></p>

        <p>
            He&hellip; He had just been fighting All for One with Kacchan,
            Toogata, Amajiki, and Kirishima. Where were they? They
            didn&rsquo;t leave him behind, right? No, there were too many
            people walking around. He winced as the confusion of the
            situation did nothing to help his migraine. A car honked again,
            nearly right on top of him. Ah, he was in the middle of the
            street.
        </p>

        <p>
            Slowly, he rolled into his hands and knees, legs already
            slightly trembling from the effort. Deep breath in, and out. He
            dug his claws into the smooth concrete, repositioned his feet
            under him, and pushed his body onto what once was his tiptoes.
            He stumbled slightly, and his wings opened out as he shifted his
            weight to gain his balance.
        </p>

        <p>
            Blood dripped down onto the concrete below. Someone on the
            crowded sidewalk screamed. Ah, right, <em>Regeneration</em> was
            still working to heal where All for One had stabbed right
            through him. Mikumo nearly tripped as a bloody cough racked his
            body for a second. More and more people were starting to crowd
            around him. None of them were offering help to him.
        </p>

        <p>
            The sounds of people and cars and shouting assault him as he
            becomes more and more aware of his surroundings. It was
            overwhelming after years of blissful silence with only the hum
            of electricity or chirping of birds to accompany him. Ignoring
            their shouts and the tiredness encroaching on him, he sprinted
            for the familiarity of the concrete mazes between buildings.
        </p>

        <p>
            Even without the use of quirks, he was fast. One of the first
            quirks he stole had been an avian mutation. It was the quirk
            that gave him the tiny wings on his back, and also transformed
            his legs into a digitigrade bone structure rather than
            plantigrade. He had to walk on his toes ever since. It was more
            efficient for running and jumping anyway, so he still benefitted
            from it, even if he had to relearn how to walk earlier on.
        </p>

        <p>
            Civilians continued to scream in alarm at the sight of him even
            as he ducked into an alley. No one followed him, but he could
            hear them huddling at the entrance behind him as he turned the
            corner through the maze of passageways. He knew Musutafu&rsquo;s
            broken pathways almost like the back of his own hand after
            patrolling the ruins of the city for over a year.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once far enough away, he slumped against the wall and breathed.
            He tilted his head back and closed his eyes. Everything was hard
            to make sense of as the headache pounded in time with his fast
            heartbeat. Tatooin Station wasn&rsquo;t in ruins, he could even
            faintly hear the screech of iron as a train made a stop in the
            distance. The alleys lacked any of the rubble, dust, and dirt he
            was used to. People bustled and talked freely on the streets as
            if noumu didn&rsquo;t exist.
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>As if noumu didn&rsquo;t exist&hellip;</em> Mikumo opened
            his eyes and got to his feet as he started to scale the side of
            the building he had been sitting against. There were fewer
            footholds than normal, but that didn&rsquo;t stop him. He
            reached the railing to the roof in no time, vaulting himself
            over to stand on solid ground once again.
        </p>

        <p>
            The unbroken skyline of Musutafu stared back at him. Not a
            single ruin in sight except for some smoke in the distance. As
            was typical before The Fall of Heroes two years ago. Before All
            Might died months before that.
        </p>

        <p>Was he actually in the past?</p>

        <p>
            Or did history just repeat itself so well that the future after
            All for One looked identical to the past? Was time so cruel? He
            didn&rsquo;t want to believe it. No matter how much more
            impossible being in the past would be compared to the future, he
            hoped that everything wasn&rsquo;t for nothing. That everything
            everyone had been through hadn&rsquo;t been for nothing. The
            future should never be like the past, otherwise what was the
            point of it all?
        </p>

        <p>
            The unbroken skyline only stared back. He wouldn&rsquo;t have
            any answers if he stayed here, but he was also so tired. He had
            strained his quirk, hell, <em>quirks</em> to their limits along
            with his body. Mikumo wanted and needed rest before he could do
            anything about this new predicament. He was safe for now, and
            that's all that mattered at the moment. He could figure it out
            after a nap.

            Mikumo awoke slowly from where he was cured up on a roof.
            Sleeping atop buildings had been the norm for him for a while
            when he had wandered across Japan for about a year sometime
            after The Fall. Although, he did miss sleeping within a nest of
            blankets already. For old times sake, he urged
            <em>Pocket</em> to bring out a sketchbook and pencil into his
            open hands with a flicker of pink light.
        </p>

        <p>
            A little later, the image of the complete city skyline as the
            sunrise glowed behind the high rises came to life. Mikumo felt a
            little better, getting to his feet to actually start his day.
            His headache was mostly gone. The previous pain and exhaustion
            dulled to only an ache. Praise be
            <em>Regeneration</em>. He would have died from being impaled
            without that quirk.
        </p>

        <p>
            He stretched all his limbs then entered a sprint, jumping across
            the gap between buildings. Small wings only as long as his arms,
            made of speckled white, gray, and black feathers, opened to
            catch the air, allowing him to glide a little further than he
            might be able to without them. Wind swept his hair as he ran
            across the city.
        </p>

        <p>
            The ocean beyond Takoba Beach stretched to the horizon in the
            distance. Mikumo had cleaned the beach and made an abandoned
            camper into his home there. Raised garden boxes held all
            different kinds of fruits, vegetables, flowers, and even a few
            young trees. Some of the trash had been repurposed into small
            art decorations he created to further liven up the area he
            called home.
        </p>

        <p>And it was gone.</p>

        <p>
            Mikumo had been expecting to see the large piles of trash
            scattered across the sand, but it still stung. The loss
            wasn&rsquo;t as soul crushing as when his mother, Midoriya Inko,
            had died, nor even close to watching Jaku General Hospital
            crumble to dust. After all, he had been leaving this home behind
            to begin a new one before All for One showed up. One that would
            have hopefully had people who didn&rsquo;t mind what he was,
            what he could do.
        </p>

        <p>
            It still stung that all his hard work cleaning the beach and
            memories etched into the sand were erased. As if it had never
            happened. It&hellip; <em>it didn&rsquo;t happen here</em>. He
            actually was in the past. Everything he lived through and did
            had no effect on this world. Mikumo never existed in this time,
            until he did. Until he woke up bleeding on the pavement in front
            of Tatooin Station with a past only he remembers.
        </p>

        <p><em>Holy shit</em>.</p>

        <p>What did he do now?</p>
    </div>

    <br />
    <hr />
    <br />

    <div>
        <p>
            Mikumo&rsquo;s first order of business in this new time was
            getting some new clothes. Thankfully, the beach had some that
            could fit him and didn&rsquo;t smell too bad, hidden in one of
            the deeper piles. The camper didn&rsquo;t exist in the piles at
            all. It had yet to be abandoned here. And wasn&rsquo;t that a
            curious thought?
        </p>

        <p>
            After changing, he stood on a run-down pier, slightly less worn
            than the first time he stood here, and looked out across the
            sea. His wings were folded against his back, hidden under the
            black shirt he now wore. A checkered forest green jacket sat
            across his shoulders and covered scarred arms. Dark jeans that
            didn&rsquo;t quite fit hung down to just above his ankles. His
            bare feet tapped against the wood, it wasn&rsquo;t like any
            shoes would fit him anyway, he was used to feeling the ground
            under him.
        </p>

        <p>
            Sighing, he then turned to leave what had been his home in
            another time. He had the chance at a new beginning. Was it bad
            that he wanted to taste peace? That he didn&rsquo;t want to go
            running into danger to change the future? The eighteen-year-old
            was tired. Tired of fighting every day to exist as he was, even
            before The Fall, before he met Garaki.
        </p>

        <p>
            Maybe it was selfish, but he never lost his will to live, his
            desire to see the world and experience new things. The dream to
            discover all he could. The pursuit of knowledge in any form. The
            rest of the world could wait. Mikumo likely had plenty of time
            before The Fall happened again, he could intervene then. For
            now, the white haired teen climbed the steps of Takoba Beach and
            disappeared into the city of Musutafu above.
