        <p>
            A young man wanders. Unknown to him, people give him a wide berth on
            the street. Mikumo was too lost in his head to notice. People
            selling food in small stands call out their menu. Cars rumble along
            the asphalt. Billboards raised into the sky show advertisement after
            advertisement for an array of superficial products. He used to be
            used to this. He had lived in this time a lifetime ago.
        </p>

        <p>All of it was overwhelming.</p>

        <p>
            Countless hues passed him by, reminding him of the black sea he
            almost drowned in. No&hellip; more like the spiral of color that
            hung within his own mind. That&rsquo;s better. Although, these were
            people, not quirks.
        </p>

        <p>
            The smell of trash, food, exhaust, and petrichor all assaulted his
            nose. He could almost taste it all from how strong it was. Mikumo
            was used to the salt in the sea breeze and stagnant pressure of dust
            within abandoned buildings.
        </p>

        <p>
            His wings shifted under his shirt, the fabric slightly pulling on
            his feathers. Makeshift bandages wrapped around his wrists and
            ankles, squeezing him comfortingly. The plaid green jacket he
            acquired hung around his shoulders, further grounding him with the
            weight.
        </p>

        <p>
            There was so much to see and explore. To rediscover. Excitement
            bubbled up within him. The cities were standing tall, the locals,
            the specialties, the atmosphere was all here. A small corner store
            painted in blue caught his eye. It was one that hadn&rsquo;t cared
            about his quirk status in middle school.
        </p>

        <p>
            The shop had all sorts of things anyone could want; snacks, drinks,
            pencils, pens, paper, and paint. Notebooks. A bell chimed as he
            entered, &ldquo;Good Morning! Welcome to Creative Corner!&rdquo; The
            shopkeeper wasn&rsquo;t the older lady he was expecting to see. No,
            the girl standing behind the counter looked to be around sixteen.
            <em>Was this the same woman?</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            Short light blue hair fell into messy curls that complemented eyes
            the same shade as sapphires. She seemed to smile softly as Mikumo
            ducked his head down and quietly returned, &ldquo;Hello.&rdquo; God,
            when was the last time he had to make small talk? Please don&rsquo;t
            drag him into that hell. Hardly any of the local shops had wanted to
            talk to him before anyway due to his well known quirklessness.
        </p>

        <p>
            Thankfully, the girl let him be as he moved on to the back corner of
            the store. Sakeru cheese, mochi, pocky, onigiri, and all sorts of
            bento stared back at him. When was the last time he was able to have
            any of this without cooking it himself? On old instinct, a flicker
            of pink appeared around the items for less than a fraction of a
            second as he reached for them. Thankfully, he remembered and stopped
            himself.
        </p>

        <p>
            He needed to pay for these, didn&rsquo;t he? Really, it hit him like
            a train. <em>He was in the past</em>. Laws and regulations and
            social expectations existed again. He lived in a
            <em>society&hellip;</em> Even using his quirks was illegal unless he
            got a license. Which would require getting his quirk added to the
            national quirk registry&hellip; Ah.
        </p>

        <p>
            Mikumo would have to think on that one. While registering
            <em>All for One</em> would be fine on paper, All for One was still
            out there. Given what he knew about the man and the implied
            influence he had seen when working for Doctor Garaki, being in the
            quirk registry would not end well for him. Nothing truly stopped him
            from just refusing to register a quirk for now.
        </p>

        <p>
            Well, there was also the Hero Public Safety Commission to possibly
            be wary of, too. What would they do if they saw
            <em>All for One</em> in the registry? Would they give him a chance?
            Did they even have information on All for One himself to be able to
            recognize the quirk? Surely they did&hellip; Although, if they knew
            about the ancient man, why let him continue hiding in the shadows?
        </p>

        <p>
            Hmm, maybe Mikumo would have to look into the commission as well.
            They might be an enemy to him on the principle of his own existence.
            Oh, that&rsquo;s not even factoring the time travel too&hellip; Was
            that legal? Were there even laws on traveling back in time yet?
        </p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;Hey are you okay?&rdquo; The white haired teen startled,
            dropping the banana pocky he had been holding. &ldquo;Oh! Sorry. I
            didn&rsquo;t mean to scare you.&rdquo; It was the store clerk. The
            concern in her deep blue eyes was genuine as she stared slightly up
            at him.
        </p>

        <p>&ldquo;Oh, y-yeah, I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;You were looking really intensely at that pocky while
            muttering under your breath. It was kind of creepy, but whatever.
            You good?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            His hand came up to rub at the back of his neck as he slightly
            diverted his gaze. &ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m just realizing I
            don&rsquo;t have any money.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            She slightly teased, &ldquo;Forget your wallet?&rdquo; Mikumo
            sighed.
        </p>

        <p>&ldquo;Something like that.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure my mom won&rsquo;t mind if we&rsquo;re missing
            a box of pocky.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            The girl had winked at him. Although, Mikumo found himself still
            taken aback, &ldquo;No, I couldn&rsquo;t! This is your shop, right?
            I can&rsquo;t just take it without paying!&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;Well, you clearly wanted it badly enough to stare it down so
            hard. Pocky isn&rsquo;t much, just take it. Besides! Just promise to
            come back another time and maybe buy me one as payment! Good?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s not like I can just take from the stock
            anytime I want. Besides, plenty of interesting people come by, and I
            like hearing their stories. Perfect inspiration for my music and
            writing! And, <em>you</em> look like an interesting person.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            Interesting, huh? That could be a way to put his general existence.
            His status as an outcast as a child, a quirkless freak, then
            studying under one of the most skilled and knowledgeable but maniac
            quirk scientists in the world. Finding himself as an unwilling
            experiment and waking up drowning. Defying commands that wormed
            their way into his mind as his home crashed down into dust around
            him. The country descending into chaos as he clawed his own relative
            peace into a small corner of the wreckage. Reconnecting with
            Kacchan, the fight, waking up here&hellip;
        </p>

        <p>
            Blue eyes were looking at him again as the girl poked his arm,
            &ldquo;Are you sure you&rsquo;re good, dude?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            Even he wasn&rsquo;t sure if he really was okay. A distraction,
            likely for both of them, he blurted out, &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t you
            be looking over the store?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            She blinked. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the only one here.&rdquo; Green
            eyes scanned over the aisles, no one else was in sight. The girl
            poked his arm again, &ldquo;Come on, you look slightly out of it.
            Come sit over by the counter, eat that pocky, and I&rsquo;ll get you
            some water.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            Silently, he nodded and followed her through the store. He was
            having too many moments getting lost in his head this morning. There
            was just so much happening, so much to remember, so much to do to
            even live within this time. He couldn&rsquo;t just wander like he
            had before. It was overwhelming, even as his mind continued to
            process and develop a plan of action through it all.
        </p>

        <p>
            A small bench set against the wall behind the counter gave off a
            small creak as Mikumo sat down on it. His eyes turned to the large
            window at the front of the store, next to where the checkout was.
            People continued to crowd the sidewalks and streets outside as they
            hurried their way to work, meetings, or school.
        </p>

        <p>
            A bottle nudged his arm and he turned back to the blue girl,
            &ldquo;Here you are. My name is Aoitake Ruka by the way.
            What&rsquo;s yours?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>&ldquo;Mikumo.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;No last name?&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t move or say anything.
            &ldquo;Well then, Mikumo, you seem to have a lot on your mind, wanna
            share any of it? Maybe it will help you sort through it all!&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            He continued to stay silent. There was too much to cover, much less
            to a stranger.
            <em
                >Like yeah, I&rsquo;m just homeless, half nameless, don't even
                exist in any records because I should not be here!</em
            >
            He&hellip; he shouldn&rsquo;t be here. He was on his way to one of
            Nedzu&rsquo;s bases with Kacchan, Toogata, Amajiki, Kirishima,
            Ashido, and Kouta. He should be there!
        </p>

        <p>
            Breathe in, breathe out. What's done is done, he can only do as he
            always has. Keep moving forward. One step at a time. Hell, he
            didn&rsquo;t even know what year it was yet. He looked back at
            Aoitake sitting next to him, &ldquo;What year is it?&rdquo; Her eyes
            widened.
        </p>

        <p>&ldquo;Twenty-one thirty-six. The eighteenth of April.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;Fuck.&rdquo; Mikumo knew he probably had time to explore
            around before having to fight but six years?! A decade in the past.
            He actually needed a long term job if he wanted to get resources
            like food, water, and whatever else. &ldquo;Is your mom by chance
            hiring or know any place that would be looking to hire?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            Curiosity burned in her gaze, but Aoitake still answered his
            question rather than asking her own, &ldquo;Ah&hellip; well, we
            aren&rsquo;t hiring, but you might have some luck with some of the
            other local shops.&rdquo; He sighed. &ldquo;Anyway, you still
            haven&rsquo;t opened that pocky. Eat dude.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            She shoved the box towards him again as he resigned,
            &ldquo;Alright.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            Opening the box and handing a few sticks over to her, they quietly
            sat in the empty store together while slowly eating the snack. The
            whole experience was strange to him. He looked back out the window
            as he thought it over. Ten years. How had this peace and the
            bustling of the city compared to the widespread destruction, decay,
            and fear only been a few years apart?
        </p>

        <p>
            The sound of a pencil gliding over paper filled the relative
            silence. Seconds ticked into minutes as Mikumo felt himself start to
            relax. His mind began to slow for the first time since waking up.
            Glancing over at Aoitake, he saw that she was sketching&hellip;
            Sketching him. He watched as each stroke brought a small caricature
            of him to life.
        </p>

        <p>
            He couldn&rsquo;t help but speak up as she seemed to be finishing
            the basic drawing, &ldquo;I actually have wings, they&rsquo;re just
            small enough to fit under my clothes.&rdquo; She gasped at that,
            veritable stars were in her eyes as she rounded on him in an
            instant.
        </p>

        <p>&ldquo;Really?!&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Er&hellip; yeah.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so cool! I knew you were interesting. You have
            to tell me more sometime!&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            Maybe he would. Just&hellip; not today. He got to his feet a minute
            later, wanting to brave the city streets once more. Aoitake grabbed
            his arm again, &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Mikumo hummed questioningly.
            &ldquo;Do come by again! It was nice to sit with someone else my age
            for once. Usually only the elderly sit with me and tell me
            things.&rdquo; Her genuine tone then shifted into something more
            playful, &ldquo;It would also be good for business!&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            He smiled, &ldquo;Well, if it's for business, then I&rsquo;ll have
            to, huh?&rdquo; A small cheer sounded behind him as the door chimed
            above, and he stepped through to the world beyond. The smell of
            asphalt and exhaust greeted him as he breathed deeply once more.
            Sounds assaulted his ears even as he ducked into an alley a few
            minutes later and scaled the side of a building.
        </p>

        <p>
            White curtly hair swayed in the breeze as Mikumo leaned backwards
            against the railing. His eyes were closed as he allowed the
            background din of the city below to wash over him. Slowly growing
            accustomed to the noise, to the chaos. As time continued to tick
            away, he felt more and more grounded to his new present.
        </p>

        <p>
            Thoughts wandered to his past, the future. Kouta was surely mad at
            him. The boy had lost his parents when they sacrificed themselves to
            save people they didn&rsquo;t even know. The Water Hose had then
            been praised for their sacrifice, celebrated for their deaths.
            Mikumo could only assume that it looked like he died to all of them.
        </p>

        <p>
            The teen had saved Kouta from a noumu after the kid got separated
            from the resistance group led by Nedzu. Since then, they had become
            each other&rsquo;s family in the bleak world left in the wake of The
            Fall of Heroes. He&hellip; he wouldn&rsquo;t see Kouta again, would
            he? At least not <em>his</em> Kouta.
        </p>

        <p>
            Tears fell as he thought of his brother in all but blood&hellip;
            <em>Kacchan</em>. They had only just reconnected after four years.
            Both of them had changed <em>so much</em>. The blonde had apologized
            for everything, and Mikumo couldn&rsquo;t help but forgive him with
            open arms. Without his mother, Kacchan, Aunt Mitsuki, and Uncle
            Masaru was all he had left. Even then, he hadn&rsquo;t trusted the
            Bakugous when he needed them most.
        </p>

        <p>
            What would have happened if he had run to Aunt Mitsuki rather than
            going with Doctor Garaki? How much would that have changed? Mikumo
            sighed. He would still be quirkless. The Fall of Heroes would still
            have happened. It&hellip; it was unlikely he would have been able to
            survive or contribute to anything after The Fall. A quirkless person
            wasn&rsquo;t strong enough to help others like a hero would.
        </p>

        <p>
            He could never be a hero. Not when he had lacked the power to be
            one. Not when he had the power of a true demon flowing through his
            veins. Not when he had helped create the creatures that stalked the
            nightmares of survivors in the wilderness outside All for
            One&rsquo;s empire.
        </p>

        <p>
            There was no going back to change his own past. There was no going
            back to his own time. Although, he already refused to sit back for
            The Fall of Heroes. He had six years before then. Six years to live
            his own life free from the noumu, from the Good Doctor, from Lord
            All for One. Maybe the sentiment was selfish, but he wasn&rsquo;t a
            hero.
        </p>

        <p>
            Mikumo had no allies, friends, or family, but he also had no enemies
            seeking him out. As long as he didn&rsquo;t reveal himself too soon,
            hid the fact that he was a demon lying in wait, he could possibly
            change the future for the better for this version of his family.
        </p>

        <p>
            Large tears still fell as he allowed himself to mourn everything
            that had happened. When would the universe stop taking everything
            from him time and time again? His mother, his home, his brother.
            Breathe in, breathe out. One step in front of the other.

            After calming down and leaping off the roof, Mikumo continued to
            wander the streets. He asked shop after shop if they were hiring.
            All of them turned him down, asking information he couldn&rsquo;t
            give or even, in one case, for his mutant features. His legs bent at
            weird angles, giving the illusion of two knees, while his canines
            were too sharp to be normal.

        <p><em>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your quirk?&rdquo;</em></p>

        <p><em>&ldquo;Scram, freak.&rdquo;</em></p>

        <p><em>&ldquo;No last name? Get lost.&rdquo;</em></p>

        <p>
            <em
                >&ldquo;No, sorry. We&rsquo;re not hiring at the
                moment.&rdquo;</em
            >
        </p>

        <p>
            <em
                >&ldquo;Maybe the shop across the street will have an
                opening?&rdquo;</em
            >
        </p>

        <p><em>&ldquo;You gotta at least have some ID, kid.&rdquo;</em></p>

        <p>
            Mikumo hadn&rsquo;t even been that aware of mutation class quirks
            receiving similar discrimination as the quirkless. It made perfect
            sense, though. The unevolved and the inhuman, considered lesser than
            the rest. Not fully human.
        </p>

        <p>
            Continuing to walk along the side of the street, he tilted his head
            back and sighed to the clouds above. It was the late afternoon and
            his head was vastly clearer than that morning, now noticing how
            people seemed to avoid him as he went along. It wasn&rsquo;t every
            single person, but enough for him to catch it.

            Musutafu Library neared as the teen slowed. The building had curving
            walls made of brick and glass. It was quite old but still had a
            beautiful style to it. If he remembered correctly, there should be
            some free to use computers that he could use to look online for jobs
            or possibly try forging an ID.
        </p>

        <p>
            Well, that was as good of a start as any compared to the continuous
            rejection from the local stores. Mikumo stepped into the main
            branch. Several levels with rows of bookshelves greeted him. The
            main floor led to a railing overlooking the bottom floor, while
            another towered above him in the air. Swooping ramps and staircases
            crisscrossed across the space, large enough for people up to four
            meters tall to fit into the spaces between the floors.
        </p>

        <p>
            Every upper level looked over the main entrance and kiosk. Thousands
            of books lined the dozens of shelves. Each with their own story,
            history, and complexity. He would never be able to read them all.
            The last time he was here, water from an overnight storm poured
            though a hole in the roof, watering plants and vines that had begun
            to creep around the fake gold phoenix statue in the center.
        </p>

        <p>
            A librarian with pastel pink hair and yellow eyes made his way over
            to Mikumo, &ldquo;Hello. Welcome to Musutafu Library. Do you need a
            library card?&rdquo; The man was on the taller side, wearing dark
            slacks and a white turtleneck to accentuate his thin height. Circle
            glasses the same shade of pink as his hair sat upon his nose.
        </p>

        <p>
            He paused for a moment to consider it, &ldquo;Do I need one to
            access the computers?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>&ldquo;Yes, you do.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Then, yes please.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>
            The man clapped his hands softly with a smile, &ldquo;Right this way
            then!&rdquo; They made their way over to the kiosk in the center.
            &ldquo;Give me a moment to get the system up to register you.&rdquo;
            The teen waited awkwardly as the man clicked around on the computer
            behind the desk. &ldquo;Alright, I&rsquo;ll need your name and
            address please.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            Mikumo paused, &ldquo;Just Mikumo and, uh, I don&rsquo;t have an
            address at the moment.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            The man looked over at him. Seeming to analyze him before sighing,
            &ldquo;Running away from home?&rdquo; He sighed. &ldquo;Too many
            kids like you, here come on. What&rsquo;s your new name?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen too many people like you. Running from
            something or someone. People just down on their luck with nowhere to
            go. So, any thought to your new name in life?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>&ldquo;I- what? No.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;People will not take you seriously without a last name, kid.
            I can give you an address for mail, but the name is yours.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            This was the second time today a stranger offered to help him in
            some way without him asking for it. &ldquo;Why help me?&rdquo; The
            man looked at him sadly.
        </p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;Exactly that right there. Too many young folks that were
            never given a hand in their time of need. So many of them either
            mutants or quirkless as the system favors the strong emitters and
            transformation class people. I have some friends that can create new
            identities if your old one is a danger to you, what you do with your
            new life is up to you.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the price?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>
            A sigh. &ldquo;Nothing. My connections and I just like helping those
            in need. I doubt the police would help you get a new identity
            without divulging your old one, hm? The system doesn&rsquo;t protect
            those on the fringes of society.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            He was silent as he thought about it. The guy seemed genuine in his
            offer. What was his name? He hadn&rsquo;t thought much about a last
            name, but one came to mind abruptly and felt <em>right</em>,
            &ldquo;Akatani&hellip; Akatani Mikumo.&rdquo;
