        <p>
            Water dripped in a steady pattern from a hole in the back of the
            warehouse. A thundering tempo compared to the muffled torrent of
            rain hitting the metal roof over Mikumo&rsquo;s head. The storm
            seemed to drench the very air around him in the night chill.
        </p>

        <p>
            Wind howled as it flowed between every crack and crevice available
            to it. Whipping around the massive buildings that made up the
            district. Apartments and warehouses littered the area he found
            himself in for the evening.
        </p>

        <p>
            He hadn&rsquo;t slept well, even with the constant drum of rain
            trying to lure him into slumber. The taste of dust in an abandoned
            warehouse sat heavy on his tongue. The open space felt too much like
            an old home. A home that was turned to dust at the hands of
            Shigaraki Tomura two years ago. A home that had been an unknowing
            prison for his mind.
        </p>

        <p>
            A home he both missed and loathed, only truly existing within his
            memories. Jaku General Hospital now stood once more, the laboratory
            underneath likely already operational, holding up its foundations.
            The rafters, lofts, and his room would be empty with no trace of him
            ever even being there. Back to the dusty, forgotten state they had
            been in before he cleaned them up and made those spaces his.
        </p>

        <p>
            It was all&hellip; complicated. Garaki had almost been like a father
            to him, taking him in when his mother had died. He had comforted
            Mikumo when he broke down over the fresh loss. The doctor had seen
            him as useful when everyone left around him at the time called him
            useless.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Good Doctor had taken that trust and twisted it, turning his
            home into a cage. Taken away his memories so he couldn&rsquo;t
            remember being free to know the difference. Implanted the
            programming done on the noumu so he wouldn&rsquo;t question anything
            that seemed wrong.
        </p>

        <p>
            Thunder rolled above, reminding Mikumo that he wasn&rsquo;t deep
            underground. He wasn&rsquo;t Garaki&rsquo;s <em>pet</em>, as All for
            One called him once. The thread controlling his mind had snapped
            years ago. Loosening when he ignored the feeling telling him not to
            worry, fraying when he disobeyed, and breaking when he
            <em>remembered</em>.
        </p>

        <p>He was free.</p>

        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            Mikumo yawned widely within the comforting atmosphere provided in
            Nekohana. The smell of coffee was the only thing helping him stay
            awake. One of the cats, Dragon, sat on the counter and purred loudly
            as he ran his fingers through her soft white fur.
        </p>

        <p>
            Behind him, Tamakawa was busy preparing an assortment of treats that
            could be bought along with a handful of first come, first served
            breakfasts off the menu. A decent incentive for some regulars to
            show up bright and early.
        </p>

        <p>
            Mikumo yawned again and rested his head on his hand as he leaned
            over the counter. A voice spoke up as he rested his eyes,
            &ldquo;Sleep well, Akatani?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>Drowsily, he mumbled out, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;The storm keep you up all night?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>Well&hellip; &ldquo;Something like that.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>
            A small bell softly rang out as Hayami made it through the entrance.
            The storm hadn&rsquo;t let up, only quieting into a light rain,
            leaving them looking mildly drenched. Even so, they held an upbeat
            tone for once as they greeted, &ldquo;Morning.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            Intrigued, Mikumo questioned, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s got you in a
            bright mood this early?&rdquo; Ah, that came out a little harsher
            than he intended, but Hayami seemed to brush it off and continue.
        </p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Friday! Some of the best customers come on
            Fridays!&rdquo; Omen finally made an appearance, demanding to be pet
            as he listened. &ldquo;Also, a lot of the corporate workers only
            work Monday through Friday, so they're in better moods.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            Tamakawa spoke up, &ldquo;Do either of you want something on the
            house?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>&ldquo;Sure, Tama. Souffle pancakes, please.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t have to, Tamakawa-san.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;Shush kid, with how tired you are, I doubt you made anything
            before coming here today. Did you?&rdquo; Mikumo stayed silent.
            &ldquo;Jeez, Akatani, none of my employees will work hungry.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            He didn&rsquo;t want to bother the man with making him something.
            Skipping meals was normal for him, &ldquo;You r-really don&rsquo;t
            ha&ndash;&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>The cat hybrid cut him off, &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;I- uh, whatever Hayami is getting?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>
            Tamakawa sighed but got to work serving them a light breakfast as
            the first few customers streamed through the door. Hayami had not
            been lying about people being in a better mood on Fridays. A man who
            looked close to collapsing each day he came in for a black coffee
            seemed to possess just a hint of alertness that morning.
        </p>

        <p>
            Eventually the pancakes were done, and the heteromorph forced both
            of them to take a break while they ate at the bar. For once, he
            watched as Tamakawa made coffee orders and manned the register
            rather than hanging back. He even placed a coffee in front of him at
            some point that he didn&rsquo;t even ask for, walking away before
            Mikumo could protest.
        </p>

        <p>
            By the late morning, the storm had finally passed and sunlight
            streamed through the large window at the front. A few of the cats
            lounged in the sunlight on the sofa, and the few who regularly
            worked on laptops within the cafe typed away in their usual spots.
        </p>

        <p>
            The coffee Tamakawa made for him had cooled to room temperature, but
            was still delicious as he sipped on it. He leaned against the
            counter and just watched as people passed by the window outside.
            Every single one of them had their own lives. Their own history and
            struggles and dreams.
        </p>

        <p>
            This was probably the most relaxed Mikumo had been in a while. He
            closed his eyes to focus on the soft patter of keys, and cats, and
            people on the sidewalk passing by. Even if it had only been a week,
            the smell of coffee felt like home. Everything was going to be okay.
        </p>

        <p>
            Someone entered the cafe, signaled by the soft chime of the door.
            Emerald green eyes met sky blue. Her outfit was a little more out
            there compared to other patrons, a wide v-neck shirt hung from her
            shoulders as a black skirt that matched her hair dropped to only
            halfway down her thigh. Knee-high boots of the same color only
            emphasized how short the skirt was.
        </p>

        <p>
            The woman pushed her red glasses up and smirked, &ldquo;My, my. I
            didn&rsquo;t know there would be <em>fresh meat</em> on the menu
            today&hellip;&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>What?</em> Mikumo quickly scanned the display case for what she
            could be talking about. He could have sworn that everything Tamakawa
            had made earlier didn&rsquo;t include meat. Was he so tired that he
            missed something on the menu for today?
        </p>

        <p>
            Hayami was busy starting to make drinks behind him as he spoke up
            with a sigh, &ldquo;Kayama, you&rsquo;re confusing him. It&rsquo;s
            the same as always, right?&rdquo; Oh, this was a <em>regular</em>.
            Not just one of the people who showed up routinely, but one
            interesting enough that his co-worker actually remembered her name.
        </p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; Kayama walked up to the display and leaned over
            it with her head held up by her wrist. Looking slightly up at him
            over her glasses, she asked, &ldquo;And what&rsquo;s your name,
            <em>sweetie</em>?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            He leaned slightly back from her proximity, &ldquo;U-uh&hellip;
            Akatani?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;Are you asking <em>me </em>what your name is?&rdquo; she
            asked in almost a purr.
        </p>

        <p>&ldquo;What? N-no! It&rsquo;s Akatani Mikumo.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>
            She lightly chuckled, &ldquo;Already a stuttering mess! How
            <em>adorable</em>!&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;Alright, that&rsquo;s enough, Kayama.&rdquo; Hayami set down
            three drinks and a small bag on the counter before motioning for her
            to pay up at the register.
        </p>

        <p>
            The woman pouted, &ldquo;Aw, you&rsquo;re no fun!&rdquo; She walked
            around to the pay register while pulling out a card and paid for the
            assortment of items before finally leaving, although not before
            turning to wink at Mikumo.
        </p>

        <p>
            Hayami sighed and rested a hand on his shoulder, &ldquo;Just ignore
            her antics. She likes messing with people by being quite&hellip;
            <em>forward</em>. It can be entertaining to watch her do it to other
            people once she gets bored with you.&rdquo; They then turned back to
            lean against the wall.
        </p>

        <p>
            Mikumo could only stare where Kayama had come and gone. Still off
            kilter from whatever whirlwind that was. Wait, &ldquo;Was that why
            you were in such a good mood earlier? You knew this would happen
            today?&rdquo; Hayami only shrugged, scrolling on their phone.
        </p>

        <p>&hellip; Oh god, she was a <em>regular</em>.</p>

        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            Kayama Nemuri hummed a tune that had been stuck in her head all day
            as she made her way back to her apartment. The new guy at Nekohana,
            Akatani, was already intriguing to her. Beyond how odd his mutations
            were, she wasn&rsquo;t one to judge on that, it was also the vibes
            she got from him.
        </p>

        <p>
            He seemed to still hold an air of innocence around him, especially
            with how her innuendos evidently flew right over his head. Cute.
            Yet, he also held himself like someone who had experienced far too
            much. Hell, Akatani had to be at least a few years younger than her,
            yet his arms were already littered with tiny scars from what she
            could see.
        </p>

        <p>
            There was even an electrical burn around his right wrist. One
            normally caused by sustained or high exposure to an electricity. One
            that wasn&rsquo;t easy to accidentally acquire. One that required a
            lot of energy, <em>and pain</em>, to develop. A type of burn usually
            only seen in the aftermath of when electric quirks are used
            offensively.
        </p>

        <p>
            Well, that train of thought really soured her mood. He already
            seemed too innocent in her mind to be the type to attack other
            people, at least unprovoked. She wasn&rsquo;t sure if it was better
            or worse that all of the scars looked old as well.
        </p>

        <p>
            She finally stepped onto the floor her apartment was on within the
            complex, knocking on the door with her heel since her arms were
            full. Hizashi opened the door for her, &ldquo;Yo, yo! You got the
            goods!&rdquo; The blond never failed to be excited over their weekly
            hangout treats.
        </p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;Yep!&rdquo; Her persona from earlier still leaked through,
            &ldquo;Now be a <em>good boy</em> and I might give it to you.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;Whoa! Something on your mind, Nemuri?&rdquo; He took his own
            sugary concoction of a strawberry hot chocolate and snagged the bag
            from her hand.
        </p>

        <p>
            Sidestepping around him, she found Shouta already draped across her
            couch like an ungraceful cat. Hizashi simply followed after her,
            helping to distribute everything she brought back, while the black
            haired man woke back up. &ldquo;Well&hellip; There&rsquo;s a new
            barista at Nekohana.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            The blond slightly perked up at that, &ldquo;Oh! So you were messing
            with them? You&rsquo;re normally good about reigning it in again
            afterward, though.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;Yeah&hellip; He was still on my mind because&hellip; god,
            he&rsquo;s younger than us, but he has more scars than the three of
            us combined just on his arms.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            The black haired man yawned and grabbed the cup placed in front of
            him. &ldquo;So,&rdquo; Shouta drawled, &ldquo;you think he might be
            caught up in something?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            That wasn&rsquo;t quite it. &ldquo;Not really, well, actually it may
            be very possible. I don&rsquo;t know. There&rsquo;s not enough
            information to guess anything.&rdquo; She sighed,
            &ldquo;There&rsquo;s just something <em>off </em>about him. Yet, I
            got instant cinnamon roll vibes.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;Maybe I could help investigate if this is bothering you so
            much.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>Really?</em> Oh, she knew what the brunet was insinuating.
            Nemuri could laugh at the sheer audacity of this man sometimes if it
            wouldn&rsquo;t bite her in the ass, &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you banned
            from Nekohana?&rdquo; Like, seriously? He thought the owner would
            let him back into the cafe anytime soon?
        </p>

        <p>&ldquo;Irrelevant.&rdquo; he deadpanned.</p>

        <p>
            Poor Hizashi tried to speak reason into that man,
            &ldquo;Shou&hellip; You tried to steal one of the
            cats&hellip;&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;Silence.&rdquo; Glowing red eyes punctuated the order.
            Hizashi only playfully glared back and took a sip of his hot
            chocolate. Sushi finally made an appearance within the living room,
            wandering too close to where Shouta was laying and let out a noise
            of protest as he was nabbed.
        </p>

        <p>
            Nemuri took that moment to separate what was in the bag. They all
            got the same thing every Friday. A moment to de-stress from the week
            and enjoy good food in each other's company. After grabbing her
            chocolate cookie, she handed Hizashi his cake pop and tossed the bag
            with Shouta&rsquo;s lemon bread slice over to him.
        </p>

        <p>
            The orange tabby had begun purring loudly as Shouta pet him. Wanting
            to change the topic, she brought up, &ldquo;So, any progress getting
            your own place?&rdquo; If he really wanted his own cat, he needed to
            stop sleeping on the streets and crashing on their couches.
        </p>

        <p>Shouta sighed, &ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Are you still not making enough?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;No, I could afford most places, but they all seem more hassle
            than its worth. I mean, a lot of my commissions are intelligence
            gathering and stakeouts. Why should I pay for a place I won&rsquo;t
            even live in most of the time?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            What an idiot. The blond chimed in before she could say
            anything,&ldquo;You&rsquo;d have a place to reliably sleep safely
            and shower.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what your apartment is for, &lsquo;Zashi.&rdquo;
            he scoffed.
        </p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not big enough for two people!&rdquo; the blond
            cried, slightly throwing his head back in dramatics.
        </p>

        <p>
            Shouta gave his signature shit eating grin, &ldquo;Not with that
            attitude.&rdquo;
        </p>

            Mikumo squinted against the bright afternoon sun as he made his way
            through the streets. Tamakawa had let him off early for the day
            after handing him a small envelope with his name on it. Apparently
            it wasn&rsquo;t much since he only worked one, technically two, days
            last week, but it was still a lot of yen compared to what he was
            used to.
        </p>

        <p>
            When he lived in Jaku, Garaki had let him borrow a card here and
            there to go buy whatever he wanted from the nearby stores or grab
            something for the man. Mikumo never knew how much was on the card,
            but even before then, his allowance didn&rsquo;t amount to much. The
            money his mother gave him usually got spent on hero merch very
            quickly anyway.
        </p>

        <p>
            The very first stop Mikumo made with his newfound wealth was
            Creative Corner. He had made a promise over a week ago. Well, maybe
            he didn&rsquo;t outright promise to the blue haired girl that he
            would be back, but it became a promise to himself for her.
        </p>

        <p>
            A small bell rang as he walked through the door. Behind the counter
            stood an older woman with the same blue hair and eyes. The old
            shopkeeper was definitely quite younger compared to the last time he
            had seen her. He looked away and ducked his head as she caught him
            staring.
        </p>

        <p>
            Making his way to the back of the store once more, he picked up two
            boxes of banana pocky. Although, his eyes caught sight of notebooks
            in different colors that all had stars surrounding a black hole
            etched in gold. He already had two that were in black. The first had
            been right after he gave up his dreams of being a hero, and the
            second held any notes he had made on <em>All for One</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>Quirk Analysis #1</em> was filled with more than just analysis
            of quirks. It and the rest of the series were full of hypotheticals
            and the deeper connections on genetics and how quirks form. Between
            pages sat mechanical designs and other notes from the schooling
            Garaki gave him. That collection had mostly only been used within
            the laboratory. He barely used them afterward, well, before coming
            to the past that is.
        </p>

        <p>
            Picking up a red version, he studied it while he debated getting it.
            There were a few empty notebooks within the storage quirk already.
            He didn&rsquo;t need a new one. It stared back at him.
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>Analysis of the Present</em> did sound nice. This was a new
            stage in his life, after all, and starting this series in red seemed
            quite poetic of his new name.
        </p>

        <p>&ldquo;Do you need any help, sir?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>
            The shopkeeper had come up next to him while he was distracted.
            &ldquo;Oh, uh, no. I was just thinking about buying this?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            She picked up one of the notebooks from the set, &ldquo;Ah, I like
            those covers too. The stars are quite mysterious.&rdquo; She sighed,
            &ldquo;A shame people forgot to wonder about the stars once fantasy
            became reality.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;Yeah&hellip;&rdquo; He slightly panicked on the inside from
            the spontaneous conversation, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t people say that
            without quirks, we would already be traveling through space?&rdquo;
            Saved.
        </p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;I believe it! So much damage was done in the first half of
            the 21st century.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            The Dawn of Quirks. &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; A lot of information had
            also been lost or buried to time from the chaos that had reigned for
            decades. That was something Garaki had taught him about.
        </p>

        <p>
            She lightly clapped before her tone changed to something lighter,
            &ldquo;Anyway, did you want to check out or are you still looking
            around?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            Mikumo already had everything he had come for except, &ldquo;Do you
            have a daughter? Is she around? I promised to come back at some
            point and talk to her again.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;Oh, Ruka? She isn&rsquo;t helping me run the shop today. I
            don&rsquo;t know when she&rsquo;ll come in next, but I can pass the
            message if you want?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            He would have preferred to uphold his promise in person, but it
            would probably be okay, &ldquo;Yes, please. After I pay, can you
            give her one of these boxes?&rdquo; He held the pocky up, &ldquo;Oh,
            and say it's from Akatani Mikumo.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            Before nightfall fell, Mikumo found himself in a clothing store
            looking for the work attire Tamakawa had requested he got. A small
            sewing kit and scissors already sat within <em>Pocket</em> for him
            to properly fix his clothing this time.
        </p>

        <p>
            Aoitake-san had insisted he get them after seeing the rushed job on
            his current clothes and learning that he could sew. She gave him a
            small discount for them since she had pressured him into buying it,
            and as a thank you for being kind to her daughter.
        </p>

        <p>
            Standing in a changing room, he turned to look at himself in the
            mirror after tossing on a pair of black slacks and a white dress
            shirt. While the clothes were for the cafe and would be covered by
            an apron most of the time, he looked like a proper businessman. He
            reminded himself of his father&hellip;
        </p>

        <p>
            Tears dripped from his eyes to his own confusion. He hadn&rsquo;t
            thought much about Midoriya Hisashi in years. The man had worked
            long hours as an accountant, eventually moving overseas to America
            for his job. Time with him and been few and far between until one
            day he just stopped picking up calls. He stopped coming home.
        </p>

        <p>
            He can&rsquo;t remember how old he was when Hisashi abandoned him
            and Inko. It was complicated as he missed him yet blamed him for
            leaving to begin with. He couldn&rsquo;t tell if they were happy
            tears for still having a small resemblance to his dad after
            everything, or upset that he looked more like Hisashi than Inko now
            that he was older.
        </p>

        <p>
            Taking a deep breath, he wiped the tears from his freckled cheeks
            and softly smiled. Even after everything, he still looked like his
            parents. Even after his hair was changed to white and his pupils
            formed into four pointed stars,
            <strike>making him so, so similar to All for One</strike>, he could
            still see his mom&rsquo;s eyes and his dad&rsquo;s face in his own
            reflection.
        </p>

        <p>
            Maybe, just maybe, Akatani Mikumo was still Midoriya Izuku deep
            down. Even after everything. And within that moment, that was
            perfectly fine with him. For once, he was relaxed and happy. He was
            not a hero, but he wasn&rsquo;t a villain. He wasn&rsquo;t fighting
            for his life and dreams almost every day. Akatani Mikumo, once
            Midoriya Izuku, lived an average life while working in a coffee shop
            and was the freest he had ever been.
