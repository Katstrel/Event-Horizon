        <p>
            Tamakawa Seiji returned to his living room and set down a pot of tea
            for his siblings. Sansa had his ears pinned backwards in mild
            annoyance as Wakana tried to braid the orange fur sticking out in
            all directions. &ldquo;My fur is just untamable. Nothing I do looks
            good past a few hours.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Not even hair gel or spray?&rdquo; Wakana said as she briefly
            flicked her tail.
        </p>
        <p>
            Seiji watched as Sansa&rsquo;s face scrunched up in disgust,
            &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the feeling of that stuff.&rdquo; Their
            sister hummed in response but didn&rsquo;t argue or question it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Taking the brief silence as an opening, Seiji tossed a question at
            her, &ldquo;I might know what happened to that mystery man that
            appeared in front of Tatooin last April. You&rsquo;re still looking
            for tea on that, right?&rdquo; Her head snapped over to look at him
            as her pupils dilated to the widest he&rsquo;s seen in a while.
        </p>
        <p>
            Wakana had a penchant for getting sucked into mysteries, but she was
            also damn good at sniffing them out with the wide access of
            knowledge she was privy to. It helped to be a prominent figure in
            the community as a reporter. Really, if any of them were to take up
            Tomoki&rsquo;s past offers of working more underground, she would be
            the best informant out of the three of them.
        </p>
        <p>
            He kept her a little too long in suspense as her eyes narrowed,
            &ldquo;Come on! Spit it out already!&rdquo; Blotchy brown and orange
            ears pointed back. Then again, she tended to wear her heart on her
            sleeve a bit too much. As a reporter, it just made the public trust
            her more.
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Jeez, you know curiosity killed the cat, right?&rdquo; He
            couldn&rsquo;t help the pun. &ldquo;Anyway, I&rsquo;m pretty damn
            confident that the same guy is my new employee. Tomoki most likely
            sent the guy my way to keep tabs on him. Either way, the kid is
            starting to do business for him, whether he got exactly what he
            wanted from sending him here or not.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;How did he survive? The footage wasn&rsquo;t released
            publicly, but it looked like he was stabbed right through his chest
            in multiple spots. Hell, even running away like that must have taken
            a lot. Regeneration quirk, right?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;No. I haven&rsquo;t asked him anything about that incident or
            about his quirk, but I have seen his quirk in action a few times. He
            says it's more like a pocket dimension kind of thing for storing
            objects, but that could just be a cover-up for teleportation.&rdquo;
            He grinned as he fed into her curiosity, &ldquo;The real question
            would be that if his quirk <em>is</em> teleportation, why hide
            it?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Sansa interjected, &ldquo;Well, teleportation quirks are in high
            demand and tend to be monitored <em>very</em> closely. To be honest,
            I don&rsquo;t blame anyone who has a teleportation quirk for hiding
            it with what I know.&rdquo; The orange furred man shivered, and
            Seiji decided that maybe he didn&rsquo;t want to know.
        </p>
        <p>
            Wakana didn&rsquo;t share that conclusion, &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Seiji
            sighed at her antics. Curiosity may just be what kills her one day
            with how some things are <em>dangerous</em> to know. Tomoki has
            alluded to it on many occasions.
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Well&hellip;&rdquo; Sansa quieted and looked off to the side
            as if he was contemplating even explaining it. Seiji was about to
            stop him when he found his voice, &ldquo;The Hero Commission. Just,
            look, when you work closely with the commission long enough, you
            learn some things. There are missing persons cases that are closed
            from higher up all the time. Most have strong quirks that are
            quietly marked as classified later on.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Seiji wasn&rsquo;t really surprised, &ldquo;So you think the HPSC
            might be taking citizens and forcing them to work for them? How
            could someone even control a warper? They can just leave.&rdquo; He
            rubbed his face, &ldquo;Say you&rsquo;re right, how far do you think
            they&rsquo;d go?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Sansa only looked at him with a forlorn expression and shook his
            head, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to know.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            &ldquo;I should just drag you back out someplace again. You need
            more socialization.&rdquo; Mikumo tried to cut her off there, but
            she kept going, &ldquo;Maybe the mall again, since I had to leave
            early last time!&rdquo; Kayama smiled mischievously. No doubt, she
            had something planned at the mall.
        </p>
        <p>
            Glancing over at Hayami, they offered no support, turning around to
            leave him to whatever fate the woman had in store for him. Maybe
            he&rsquo;d bribe Omen to annoy them again. Tamakawa cut in for once
            as the blue-gray cat hybrid leaned against the counter to face
            Kayama, &ldquo;I hear you want to steal my employee?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;I know I can&rsquo;t just take him out when he&rsquo;s on the
            clock.&rdquo; she pouted.
        </p>
        <p>
            The older man&rsquo;s eyes flicked over to him, &ldquo;Well, Akatani
            I have been thinking of moving your hours to be flexible.&rdquo;
            Mirth filled his gaze as he continued talking, &ldquo;Come and go as
            you like. I know you&rsquo;ll be busy helping out Tomoki moving
            forward. The cafe will always be here for you if you need to get a
            little more cash or find yourself bored, though.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Mikumo paused and stared incredulously at Tamakawa,
            &ldquo;<em>What?</em>&rdquo; Did employers do that? Was this normal?
            &ldquo;Wait, so I just show up and work when I want to? I
            don&rsquo;t need to tell you when I want to come in first?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Kayama <em>grinned</em>, &ldquo;Does this start now?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
            Mikumo looked at the man in mild fear as he looked like he got the
            canary, &ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Thankfully, she didn&rsquo;t drag him out of the cafe right that
            second. Fridays were her hangout days with her other two friends,
            after all. However, it did not bode well for his morning tomorrow.
            As he watched the door swing closed behind her, he just sighed and
            resigned himself to his fate.
        </p>

        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            Faces of people he had never met and shops that he had never seen
            blurred past as Kayama dragged him by the arm through the mall. She
            was clearly excited to bring him to whatever place she had in mind
            here. Thankfully, it wasn&rsquo;t long before they started to slow
            down, and he tried to figure out what storefront was Kayama&rsquo;s
            destination.
        </p>
        <p>
            To his confusion, she led him into what looked to be a barber shop.
            &ldquo;You need a haircut! I bet those curls will look nicer and be
            easier to manage with a shorter length.&rdquo; He stared at her
            before he just sighed. He didn&rsquo;t really care what his hair
            looked like anymore, so it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt to humor her.
        </p>
        <p>
            At some point it was just easier to not bother with it unless it got
            long enough that it got in the way when he was fighting. Actually,
            that mentality may have started in Jaku and just wasn&rsquo;t
            challenged when he lived in the wild or even when he regained his
            memories. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t cared about what it looks like for
            years.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Well, that changes today!&rdquo; She looped her arm around
            his shoulders and pointed over to a mirror on the wall.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
            He still didn&rsquo;t look at himself that often, despite the mirror
            now in his living room. The exact shade of green as his mother's
            eyes were dusted by freckles that mirrored his father&rsquo;s face.
            Pure white hair curled loosely as it fell to about his shoulders.
        </p>
        <p>
            She pulled his attention away from his reflection as she asked,
            &ldquo;Do you have any preferences? If you like it long, we can just
            get it shaped up.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Ah, well, do you have any recommendations?&rdquo; Mikumo
            figured that he probably liked it shorter than it was now, but he
            also wanted to know what she was thinking for him. Without too much
            thought, he asked, &ldquo;How about you pick for me?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            She nearly squealed, &ldquo;Oh, I love makeovers and fashion!
            &lsquo;Zashi&rsquo;s like me, and Shouta won&rsquo;t let me touch
            him. You&rsquo;re going to look great when we&rsquo;re done!&rdquo;
            He sighed and smiled, hopefully he didn&rsquo;t regret this.
        </p>
        <p>
            He sparked up a conversation, asking about Yamada while they waited.
            Apparently the man loved wearing leather and looking like a punk.
            Aizawa just liked soft yet functional things. Eventually, an older
            woman called them over to sit in two open chairs next to each other.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mikumo breathed slowly the entire time, not realizing how much it
            grated his nerves to have his back to a random person with a weapon
            scissors in their hands and letting them touch him. He fought the
            urge to summon his knives each time the scissors snipped away more
            hair. It helped to close his eyes and try to sink away to his
            dreamscape even if it only offered minor relief to the anxiety
            roiling in his gut.
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Hey, Akatani, do you want to try dyeing your hair?&rdquo; He
            opened his eyes, briefly noting how his hair was about the same
            length as it was in middle school before looking at Kayama as she
            continued, &ldquo;You could get the temporary dyes that wash out.
            Since your hair is white, you can dye it super easily!&rdquo; She
            pouted, &ldquo;Lucky.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Still slightly out of it from controlling his unease, he just wanted
            to go along with whatever she suggested and get out of here,
            &ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;What color do you want to try?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I guess you pick?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
            She giggled, &ldquo;How about a color that matches your quirk?
            Bright pink!&rdquo; That helped him return a bit more to reality. He
            gaped, but she cut him off before he could even begin, &ldquo;You
            said I could pick. Besides! You can wash it out tonight.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Afterward, he walked around the mall with highlighter pink hair and
            a few pink feathers to test if the dyes worked on them too, at
            Kayama&rsquo;s insistence. She tugged him into a few different
            clothing shops to try lots of things on and to buy more clothes in
            general.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
            It was mostly more jeans, button up shirts, pun shirts to Kayama’s
            dismay, and discovering ponchos. The loose fabric covered him like a
            sweater without restricting his wings and didn&rsquo;t need any
            modifications to do so like his shirts. It was amazing. With his
            wings easily covered by the knitted white fabric, fewer people
            stared at him as he passed them by.
        </p>

        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            &ldquo;Sorry that it took a while.&rdquo; Tokai apologized as he led
            Mikumo to an office space deeper in the library. Although, he took a
            quick pause to say, &ldquo;Nice haircut.&rdquo; The room was on the
            second floor and had tinted windows that obscured the view of who or
            what was inside. &ldquo;We shouldn&rsquo;t be bothered here.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Mikumo glanced at him, &ldquo;Are you sure it's safe to use a public
            space for this?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;For this client? It should be just fine. Confidentiality is
            one of our specialties at Musutafu Library. No one outside this room
            will be able to tell what we are discussing, even if they tried.
            Although. I&rsquo;ll quickly remind you to watch your
            language.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Shit</em>. The pink haired man was good at picking apart every
            mistake he made around him. Specifying public space wasn&rsquo;t
            needed and could be suspicious for those that could overhear them.
        </p>
        <p>
            They entered the room and Tokai began introductions, &ldquo;Akatani,
            this is Sakata Keisuke.&rdquo; A small boy with light brown hair
            stared up at him with pale white eyes, briefly looking at each other
            before the child looked away. He was probably nervous to be here.
            &ldquo;Sakata, Akatani is here to help you control your
            quirk.&rdquo; A woman sitting nearby quickly dipped her head in
            greeting as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            Taking the lead, Mikumo kneeled down to be at the kid&rsquo;s height
            in front of them and smiled softly, &ldquo;Hi Sakata, would you like
            to tell me about your quirk?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            He became anxious the longer the kid didn&rsquo;t respond. &ldquo;No
            one told you?&rdquo; Sakata&rsquo;s voice was quiet as the words
            finally trembled out.
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;I suppose not! I&rsquo;ll need to know what you can do before
            I can try to help you with it. By the way, what do you need help
            with?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Sakata stayed silent for a while. Likely debating it before the
            woman spoke on his behalf, &ldquo;He scares the crap out of anyone
            he makes eye contact with. He needs more control over his
            quirk.&rdquo; That was a bit <em>blunt</em>. The boy hunched in on
            himself in response, and Mikumo glared at the woman for a second
            before turning back to Sakata.
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;So your quirk is sight based? I have heard that those types
            of quirks are more affected by emotions than most other quirks. That
            just means you need to work on controlling your emotions a little
            more than other kids.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;We can also get you some glasses that help block quirk
            effects. Did you know that sight based heroes have to be careful of
            what their glasses or goggles are made of to not hinder their
            quirks?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Sakata stared up at him now, meeting his gaze. Curiosity and
            excitement seemed to be burning away the kid's earlier anxieties.
            &ldquo;Really? It's that easy?!&rdquo; However, it didn&rsquo;t last
            long, &ldquo;None of the other doctors wanted to help
            me&hellip;&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            It had been years since Mikumo had his own quirk counseling
            appointment, the only appointment he ever had. It gave him pause
            since he couldn&rsquo;t understand why the child would be turned
            away, &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t like my quirk.&rdquo; That couldn&rsquo;t
            be the full picture, right? &ldquo;It&rsquo;s scary.&rdquo;
            Still&hellip;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Well, I think having a sight based quirk is cool! My favorite
            hero has one.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            The kid&rsquo;s gaze hardened in anger, white eyes flared with an
            ethereal glow. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get it!&rdquo; he shouted,
            looking right at Mikumo.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
            Cold sweat dripped down his back. He was about to die. All for One
            found him. The child warped into the true form of that demon. The
            surrounding room was washed away by black water. He couldn&rsquo;t
            move.
        </p>
        <p>He couldn&rsquo;t breathe.</p>
        <p><em>He couldn&rsquo;t breathe</em>.</p>
        <p>
            He breathed, and the world snapped back into position. All for One
            wasn&rsquo;t here. He wasn&rsquo;t in that man&rsquo;s dreamscape,
            surrounded by the pitch black ocean. White eyes were looking past
            him with fearful concern. &ldquo;Ah, I see.&rdquo; Sakata curled in
            on himself again. Mikumo bowed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for making
            you feel like you had to show me your quirk like that.&rdquo;&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; Sakata looked deeply confused. Maybe he could
            still salvage this?
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Have you given any thought to what you want to do when you
            grow up?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;I- what, uh, I- I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;And that is perfectly fine! I don&rsquo;t know what I want to
            do either, honestly. Either way, you don&rsquo;t need to worry about
            what your quirk can do. Plenty of jobs don&rsquo;t require a
            specific quirk,&rdquo; from what Mikumo could remember and what
            he&rsquo;d seen so far. &ldquo;Although, there are a few professions
            that showing someone their fears might be useful. I&rsquo;m sure
            you&rsquo;ll figure it out!&rdquo;&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
            He paused to find the right words, &ldquo;Quirks may be unique to
            each person, but they don't define who you are. It's what you
            personally do that matters. If you just want to control it better,
            we can find something that works for you.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            The kid looked at him dumbfounded, even the woman looked a little
            off kilter. Mikumo simply smiled widely at them and turned to Tokai,
            &ldquo;Do you have any places to send them to for working on
            emotional control or for getting those special glasses?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Tokai blinked at him before seeming to remember himself. He pulled
            the avian over and whispered, &ldquo;Are you sure you&rsquo;re okay,
            Akatani?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Sakata&rsquo;s quirk makes you experience fear on the level
            of being about to die. Sometimes accompanied by a hallucination of
            <em>being about to die</em>. How are you standing right now?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Oh. Huh. It had been a while since he last felt it, but,
            &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve faced that feeling many times already. Being able
            to keep moving has been what kept me alive.&rdquo; It was as simple
            as that. Tokai didn&rsquo;t look any better.
        </p>
        <p>
            They all finished up the counseling after that. Mikumo briefly
            taught Sakata about the feeling of quirk energy and how it's
            possible to control it with practice. It still felt like he could
            have done better or done more with trying to help.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tokai mentioned how they may be able to rename the kid&rsquo;s quirk
            to something nicer or more unassuming than
            <em>Death&rsquo;s Door</em> in the registry in the future. He needed
            his quirk counseling license before he could do that, though.

        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            The warm summer nights were a comfort against the chilly memory of
            winter. Nothing good ever seemed to happen in the early spring.
            Memories of the day he almost died for the first time, drowned for
            the first time, the same day his dream of being a Pro Hero died at
            the words of discouragement from the Symbol of Peace. That had been
            a day in early April. Only months later had he shaken the Symbol of
            Evil&rsquo;s hand.
        </p>
        <p>
            Drowning. There was a quirk that transported the noumu and people
            around. It made them briefly choke on dark gray sludge like tar.
            Teleportation was the only way in and out of a white room littered
            with claw marks and blood. A room designed to make one lose their
            mind. A place to slowly break down any remaining mind left of the
            more resistant noumu. There was no sense of time in the lab, but the
            corridors were chilly nonetheless.
        </p>
        <p>
            Drowning. The time he woke up with broken memories and purple
            solution filling his lungs. It had been around February or March.
            With reclaimed knowledge to think back, he could recognize that he
            had been spared from the full noumu process, but programming had
            still whispered in the back of his mind for years. Something akin to
            the class of experiments with the highest sapience at the end.
        </p>
        <p>
            Drowning. Waves that were as black as a starless night. Water that
            devoured all the color that laid below its surface. An equal
            representation of the exact same quirk that laid beneath his skin
            but so, so different. A man that had tried to swallow him beneath
            the waves. The ever looming threat of Lord All for One fully hung
            above him now, where it had once been a distant thought.
        </p>
        <p>That had been in April.</p>
        <p>
            The warm wind swirled around Mikumo once more where he stood with
            his eyes closed, taking him back into the moment rather than
            memories. His breath slowed as he simply listened. Zoning out hardly
            ever ends well when living out in the wastelands left behind by the
            Fall of Heroes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The ruins of Musutafu, especially by Takoba Beach, were his area.
            Nearby factions had come to learn and respect that. However, they
            were still too scared to approach the area unless doing business
            with New Musutafu, the one faction that lived within his protective
            boundary. Those people didn&rsquo;t just fearfully respect him but
            had come to depend on him to keep <em>other</em> monsters away.
        </p>
        <p>
            A growl echoed along the alleyways below. Pink light flashed as twin
            blades manifested in his grasp, ready to be stained with even more
            blood. Emerald star shaped eyes snapped open&hellip; Only to be met
            with an unbroken skyline that signified the absence of any other
            monster besides himself.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
            &hellip; That wasn&rsquo;t the first time he confused a noise in a
            back alley for a noumu. Mikumo just had to keep reminding himself
            that the year was 2136. Keep reminding himself that the noumu
            didn&rsquo;t run wild within the cities and countryside. That he
            didn&rsquo;t have to fight for his life all the time anymore.
        </p>

        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            Despite his mental slip up between memories and reality, he stayed
            out in the night. It looked like a gang of several guys had gotten
            the better of what might be a hero in the area below him. Mikumo
            still wasn&rsquo;t sure what the hell he was doing, intervening on
            more and more back alley incidents. Anxiety dug at his mind, telling
            him that if he wanted to commit to this, he needed to get a disguise
            or stop getting involved.
        </p>
        <p>
            He knew that he really should stop. This wasn&rsquo;t safe for him.
            He needed to stay safe until he could attack All for One. It
            was&hellip; It was just so long to wait, though, and this felt so
            good. He was helping people. He was doing so good.
        </p>
        <p>
            Green eyes watched as one of the four guys pulled out a knife and
            took a step forward towards the trapped hero. Wind obeyed
            Mikumo&rsquo;s command as he strengthened and redirected it into the
            alley. Precision practice in all fairness. The man with the knife
            was swiftly knocked out against the back wall.
        </p>
        <p>
            His friends looked over at him in fear. Mikumo slightly relished
            their reactions and grinned. There wasn&rsquo;t much he could do
            without giving away his position but also a lot of options. Focusing
            within <em>All for One</em>, he pulled <em>Freeze</em> around
            <em>Breeze</em>, imbuing the wind with the frigid arctic chill.
        </p>
        <p>
            The breaths of the thugs fogged in the air below his perch on the
            building above them. He could tell that they were hesitating. Well,
            the wind surged once more, blowing the three of them off their feet
            and away from the hero.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
            Mikumo let go of <em>Freeze</em> to try to confuse them even more as
            the air warmed again. At least one of them had their head on a
            swivel, trying to spot their new enemy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thankfully, they gathered their fourth friend after a minute and
            scampered out of the alley as the hero started to recover. That was
            his own cue to get out of the area as well. Shadows flickered around
            him as he closed his eyes, with a rooftop on the other side of the
            city on his mind. The skyline he had pictured greeted him as his
            eyes opened less than a second afterward.
        </p>

        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            Of course, keeping those reminders that he was safer than he had
            been in years wasn't always easy, and some days were still worse
            than others. The sound of people bustling and cars whizzing by stung
            at his ears. His mind was in overdrive, thinking every noise was a
            sign of danger.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>He was surrounded.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
            He was holding the ingredients to make himself katsudon once he made
            it back to his home in the abandoned building.
        </p>
        <p>
            Breathe in, breathe out. Right. He was getting closer to mimicking
            his mother&rsquo;s recipe. Mikumo had never asked her to teach him
            the full recipe and he had barely memorized the parts she allowed
            him to help with. He hadn&rsquo;t known that she wouldn&rsquo;t
            always be there to make it for him and teach him how to make it when
            he got older. She didn&rsquo;t get to see him grow up.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mikumo couldn&rsquo;t help but think that maybe that was for the
            best sometimes. Would she have cried and blamed herself for how and
            where he ended up? Would she have worried herself sick wondering if
            he would be okay? Would she have died painfully to a noumu rather
            than slipping away from sickness? At least she was spared from the
            monstrosities he helped the Doctor create.
        </p>
        <p>
            He managed to make it to the stairwell before he knew it, and he was
            able to let the tension drain away. Not fully, never fully. One
            could never know when danger would strike. Reaching for the
            door&hellip; he heard a sound.
        </p>
        <p>
            The bag was left forgotten as he silently entered the abandoned
            apartment.
        </p>

        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            Aoitake Ruka danced with no rhyme or reason as music played quietly
            from her phone. The assholes who liked to mess with her tried to
            chase her outside the school for once. It made her late coming home.
            Instead of worrying her mother, she sent a text saying she was
            hanging out with Mikumo.
        </p>
        <p>
            With nothing better to do, she decided to make the excuse an actual
            reason and climbed up to his apartment. Randomly coming over was a
            thing friends sometimes did, right? His absence made her start to
            second guess her decision. Surely, he wouldn&rsquo;t be mad about
            her hanging around here, right?
        </p>
        <p>
            To distract herself, she did her homework, spent a short while on
            the roof, then came back down to draw and dance and pass the time in
            any way she could. As time ticked away, she started to consider this
            as more and more of a mistake.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
            That feeling came to a head when she heard the floor quietly creak
            from the hallway. She hadn&rsquo;t heard the door open&hellip;
            Snapping her head around, she came face to face with Mikumo in the
            doorway.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
            He was crouched as if prepared to fight, two
            <em>clearly</em> heavily used short swords were clasped in each
            hand, and his gaze held something hard before it flickered into more
            of fear. The swords flickered away in the signature pink light of
            his quirk.
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;What the hell?&rdquo; That was her own voice. Really, what
            the fuck?
        </p>
        <p>
            Mikumo was still looking at her with wide eyes, &ldquo;Uh&hellip;
            What are you doing here?&rdquo; He looked away and rubbed at the
            back of his neck. No, no. He wasn&rsquo;t getting to glance over
            <em>that</em>.
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;What was up with those swords?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
            He met her gaze and slowly blinked, &ldquo;What swords?&rdquo;
            <em>Bruh</em>.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;The two swords you had been holding that you apparently have
            had for a long time? Well, based on the amount of chips in
            them.&rdquo; And the dried blood, but she didn&rsquo;t want to
            actually acknowledge that right now. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had those
            the entire time?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            He sighed, and Ruka knew she had won out against his sad attempt to
            cover that up. Pink flared again, and she was presented with the
            swords. Surprised, she picked the one that had a feather tied to the
            hilt up. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t fully remember when I got these, but
            they have saved my life on many occasions.&rdquo; That was clear
            with the amount of blood that had dried on them. &ldquo;I
            haven&rsquo;t needed to use them in a while, and just kept
            forgetting to fix them up again.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            She stayed silent as she properly looked over the swords. The blades
            were simple stainless steel with bronze hilts and black handles.
            Each of the hilts went slightly up the blade and had an engraving
            carved into it. The short sword with a feather tied to it had a
            swan, while the other had a crown.
        </p>
        <p>
            When Ruka handed them back to him, she asked, &ldquo;Do you have
            anything else?&rdquo; While it slightly unnerved her that Mikumo may
            have killed before, she could understand that being on the streets
            was not safe. He did what he could to survive, and she could not
            fault him for that in all honesty. Now she was just intrigued to
            know more, except for any gruesome details.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tension seemed to drain from him as a small smile appeared on his
            face. She was glad that it looked like he was relieved at her lack
            of negative reaction. &ldquo;I have a nonlethal weapon too.&rdquo; A
            large stick appeared in his hand. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bo staff.
            I&rsquo;ve had it longer than the swords and more formally trained
            with it.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            At some point, they sat down while Mikumo cleaned up and worked on
            repairing his swords. Ruka confessed that she just felt like coming
            over rather than heading back to her house today. He offered that
            she could hang around his place any time she felt like it, just
            maybe send him a text about being up here first.
        </p>
        <p>
            Eventually, Mikumo stepped away into the kitchen before looking back
            at her, &ldquo;Want some katsudon?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>That sounded delicious! &ldquo;Sure!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
            Apparently, katsudon was his favorite food, and he was trying to
            rediscover his late mother&rsquo;s recipe. She couldn&rsquo;t
            believe how much she was learning about her best friend today. He
            was normally so reserved to talk about things beyond their shared
            interests.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
            Ruka couldn&rsquo;t help but smile at how much he was starting to
            trust her. She hoped she could trust him too and that he would be
            just as understanding as well in the future.
        </p>

        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            Tokai had contacted him the next week with his first set of study
            materials for the quirk counseling license. Mikumo groaned over how
            it only seemed to cover the basics of what he learned with the
            Doctor. This was what the commission wanted quirk counselors to
            know? Unbelievable. A few pages were full of false information, too.
        </p>
        <p>It made him nervous.</p>
        <p>
            The librarian assured him that he likely was overqualified for the
            exam, but that the commission would want certain answers to a few
            questions. He had to know how to answer how the commission wanted
            him to, rather than how he felt about the topics. Really, the more
            he learned about the commission, the more he did not trust them.
        </p>
        <p>
            The silver lining was how Tokai mentioned that answering how someone
            else wants can be a crucial skill in the underground. It made Mikumo
            remember a few times he had done that in the laboratory under Jaku
            General Hospital to get out of a possible lecture on how he and
            society were wrong about quirk singularity.&nbsp;
        </p>

        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            Emerald green eyes stared up at the night sky. A natural breeze
            passed through Keimei Creek around him. It ruffled his feathers and
            felt similar to how the wind passed through his wings when gliding.
            With control over the air, could he create updrafts to let him fly?

            It required a tremendous amount of force to move a person with just
            the wind. Speeds only regularly seen in hurricanes and tornadoes
            could do it. So far he had only been able to create short blasts of
            those high speeds, never sustained.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
            Mikumo extended his wings to their maximum wingspan, barely past his
            fingertips. Hell, he could just barely glide. More like a controlled
            fall. What the hell was he doing? Steeling himself, he summoned the
            strongest blast he could, flinging himself into the air.
        </p>
        <p>
            The force also knocked him over. Flapping his wings did hardly
            anything for the tumble he was in. He needed time to reorient
            himself before hitting the ground, time he didn&rsquo;t have. The
            ground was getting closer, this was a mistake.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
            He closed his eyes to brace for impact with the hard ground.
            <em>All for One</em> surged in response to his panic, pulling on a
            quirk he hadn&rsquo;t tested yet but had a vague idea of what it
            might do. It felt similar to the first quirk he had ever used.
        </p>
        <p>
            The impact never came. Emerald green eyes stared at the ground just
            an arm's length away. Rocks and loose dirt leisurely floated up to
            join him in the air. <em>Gravity</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The natural wind picked up into a gust for a moment as leaves
            rustled all throughout the small forest. Mikumo sucked in a breath
            as it pushed him around the clearing and into the side of a tree. He
            grabbed on and orientated himself, still processing what the hell
            happened.
        </p>
        <p>
            He just sat and breathed and took a minute to think. The quirk
            negated gravity in a field around him based on how the dirt floated
            up too. Could he control how large the field was? Was it truly
            negating gravity, or modifying it to be as small of a force as
            possible?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>He could test that all later&hellip;</p>
        <p>
            Pushing himself away from the trunk, he floated freely through the
            air before using <em>Breeze</em> to push himself higher into the
            sky. Flapping his wings periodically to keep himself upright in his
            weightless ascent, Mikumo couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh in
            exhilaration as he truly reached for the stars for the very first
            time.
