        <p>
            &ldquo;Akatani Mikumo, huh? Well, nice to meet you, Akatani. My name
            is Tokai Tomoki. It&rsquo;ll take a day or so to get your papers
            together but come back Friday to check in with me about them. In the
            meantime, we can get your library card sorted.&rdquo; Tokai pulled
            out a few papers and a brochure, setting them in front of Mikumo.
            &ldquo;Just sign a few of these, here and&hellip; here.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            His signature was sloppy as he signed his new name for the first
            time. &ldquo;Would you happen to know anywhere that&rsquo;s hiring
            as well? I need a job.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;Hmm, I don&rsquo;t imagine you&rsquo;ll have much luck
            getting accepted anywhere till I get your paperwork for you, but I
            can hand you some business cards along with your documents either
            Friday or next week.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>&ldquo;That would be a massive help. Thank you.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;Ah! And here is your library card.&rdquo; The pink haired man
            handed the small piece of plastic to him with a flourish,
            &ldquo;Feel free to check out some books or use the computers
            downstairs.&rdquo; Mikumo nodded and made his way down to the lower
            level.
        </p>

        <p>
            He didn&rsquo;t need to use the computer for forging an identity for
            himself anymore, but it may be best to survey the city for any news
            or points of interest that he wouldn&rsquo;t have known about as a
            kid. He could do that another time. Hundreds of books lined the
            shelves and well, he had time to kill before he could do much of
            anything in the city.
        </p>

        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            Mikumo stood atop the roof of a building in the heart of Musutafu.
            The ocean glistened with red, yellow, pink, orange, blue, and purple
            in the distance. A breeze blew freely over the rest of the
            buildings, ruffling his curls. He breathed deeply, the scent of
            decay completely missing. It was still hard to believe that the city
            was actually standing and bustling around him.
        </p>

        <p>
            All Might had been the talk of the news, as was typical years ago.
            The hero was still alive and in his prime. How strange to see
            someone that had been dead for years running around and punching
            villains. Almost like a ghost.
        </p>

        <p>Oh god, his mother. She would be alive in this time.</p>

        <p>
            She&hellip; she wouldn&rsquo;t remember him. Would she recognize
            him? Did he want her to acknowledge him? She was his mother but a
            different version of her. A version from ten years ago. Would it
            hurt her to know how much he lived through? He changed so much.
            Would she accept him? Maybe he should check in on her tomorrow and
            try to decide then.
        </p>

        <p>
            He sighed as he stared back out towards the twilight over the sea.
            Stars were just beginning to peak through the atmosphere, hard to
            see with the light pollution of the city below. Even then, Mikumo
            was able to watch as a small light arced across the sky.
        </p>

        <p>
            A shooting star. Small bits of rock falling through the atmosphere,
            burning up within the atmosphere into trails of stardust. A symbol
            of good fortune and new beginnings. He could only wish that this
            time would be kinder as he rebuilt another life for himself,
            <em>again</em>.
        </p>

        <p>He was so tired.</p>

        <p>
            Mikumo yawned as he turned away from the last hints of twilight on
            the horizon. There were good things that had come about from being a
            nomad for so long, like knowing when it would rain. He was safe to
            sleep under the stars for the night.
        </p>

        <p>
            Pink light briefly reflected on the concrete below him as he
            summoned a few of the blankets he had taken years ago.
            <em>Pocket</em> was the first quirk he took after receiving
            <em>All for One</em>, and continued to be one of his favorites for
            the sheer utility it provided. Stretching as he laid down, sleep
            found him quickly.
        </p>

        <p>
            <em
                >A sinister voice laughed in his ear, &ldquo;Calm down.
                It&rsquo;ll only hurt for about forty-five seconds&hellip; Then
                it&rsquo;ll all be over.&rdquo; Light streamed in at the end of
                the underpass tunnel as he struggled. Disgusting green sludge
                encompassed him, slowing his movements, as more of the slimy
                substance forced its way down his throat.</em
            >
        </p>

        <p>
            <em
                >Each attempted breath only welcomed the intruder more. His
                fingers dug into the viscous liquid, trying to find any purchase
                to pull it out. At least until it switched directions all of a
                sudden. Black slime burst from his mouth and briefly blinded him
                before he felt the sensation of falling.</em
            >
        </p>

        <p>
            <em
                >He hit the floor as another voice seemed to purr,
                &ldquo;Doctor, your newest pet seems to have survived!&rdquo;
                The phantom sensation of pain accompanied him across his body as
                he coughed out liquid that wasn&rsquo;t there. A hand found
                itself in his hair, ruffling his curls in a comforting
                manner.</em
            >
        </p>

        <p>
            <em
                >The voice of his master sounded out above him,
                &ldquo;Relax.&rdquo; He couldn&rsquo;t help but lean into it, a
                strange feeling whispering to him to trust the man and obey.
                &ldquo;You're falling behind&hellip; My greatest creation
                yet&hellip; Unacceptable.&rdquo; His gut lurched again as he
                fell once more.</em
            >
        </p>

        <p>
            <em
                >Before stood an avian creature, a noumu with multiple quirks.
                The white feathers on its back shifted as it ran forward.
                Lifeless eyes were switched with furious white as it neared.
                Lord All for One replaced the monster as the man lifted him by
                his shirt. &ldquo;Stop resisting.&rdquo;
            </em>
        </p>

        <p>
            <em
                >The Demon King dropped him down into the pitch black ocean
                below. Countless colors swirled around him as he strained his
                senses within the inky water to orientate himself on which way
                was up. A woman&rsquo;s voice filled his ears with a panicked
                tone, &ldquo;I-I can&rsquo;t&hellip; can&rsquo;t
                breathe&hellip;&rdquo; He couldn&rsquo;t breathe&mdash;</em
            >
        </p>

        <p>
            Mikumo shot awake, coughing up imaginary fluid from his lungs,
            gasping for breath. His heart hammered inside his chest. He got to
            his feet, quickly finding himself gripping the railing as he looked
            out across the unbroken horizon. Far from the underground laboratory
            compound under Jaku General Hospital. Far from the underpass tunnel
            he almost died in. Far from his own time where it happened at all.
        </p>

        <p>
            The eastern sky was already beginning to brighten in the predawn. He
            breathed in deeply as the breeze brushed his freckled face. One of
            the brightest stars, Sirius, greeted the coming sunrise even through
            the haze of light pollution. Canis Major chased the darkness of
            night away.
        </p>

        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            Hunger gnawed at him as stores and stands opened to sell all kinds
            of meals and snacks to the busy people passing by. The animals he
            would previously find and hunt within the city were nowhere to be
            found with all the noise, smells, and people. There were likely to
            be laws against hunting anyway, and he didn't want to explain to law
            enforcement why he didn't exist in their system.
        </p>

        <p>
            It was possible that he still had some food within <em>Pocket</em>,
            but it was a toss up whether any of it could be eaten without
            cooking it first. Mikumo severely doubted that he could just make a
            fire wherever he wanted to make a meal. Not because he
            couldn&rsquo;t but because of <em>laws</em>. Damn society. Just
            taking something to eat also held the same problem.
        </p>

        <p>
            Well, okay, his options were begging for food or money. Maybe trying
            to work as payment for something to eat? He could try to be extra
            stealthy and sneak something&hellip; No. Mikumo turned as he headed
            back in the direction of the sea. No one ever cared to look at the
            dumping grounds of Takoba. He could make a small fire and cook
            something there for now.
        </p>

        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            It was past midday as Mikumo laid on the low wall of another
            rooftop, basking in the sunlight as he waited. The pink haired man
            had told him to come to the library tomorrow, and he had nothing to
            occupy him in the meantime. It was strange how he didn&rsquo;t need
            to worry about getting attacked by a noumu, but all the same, he was
            alert for any sign of danger.
        </p>

        <p>
            An apartment complex stood across from him, identical to the one he
            was perched on. Green eyes watched and waited. Time continued to
            tick away until he spotted who he had been looking for.
            <em>Midoriya Inko</em>. Her forest green hair was hung in a
            beautiful bun as bangs came down to frame her emerald eyes. The
            exact same shade as his own.
        </p>

        <p>
            He <em>knew</em> she was alive but seeing her breathing was so much
            different than just knowing it. Bakugou Mitsuki walked alongside
            her, clearly chatting with each other just outside of Mikumo&rsquo;s
            earshot. Tears fell, and it became harder for him to see. He wanted
            to just teleport down there and hug her, to mumble apologies for
            things she wouldn&rsquo;t understand.
        </p>

        <p>
            She would never fully understand. This wasn&rsquo;t
            <em>his</em> Inko. She died four years ago, and a piece of him had
            died with her. Movement caught his eye as a small green blur darted
            down the street. Wiping his eyes, he watched as Inko stumbled from
            the impact of&hellip; <em>Izuku</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
            That was him. The green haired kid had to be only eight and barely
            reached Inko&rsquo;s waist. Inko picked him up as a mini version of
            Kacchan appeared soon after.
        </p>

        <p>
            The tiny blond seemed reluctant to walk down the street to where the
            rest of them stood. After only a few moments, Mitsuki gave a quick
            hug to Inko and Izuku before walking over to where Katsuki, this
            wasn&rsquo;t <em>his </em>Kacchan, waited.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Bakugous disappeared around the corner towards their own home a
            few blocks away as Inko walked both herself and Izuku up to their
            apartment. An apartment Mikumo knew like the back of his own hand,
            despite never setting foot inside it from anyone else's perspective.
            He knew so much that he shouldn&rsquo;t,
            <em>he shouldn&rsquo;t exist</em>.
        </p>

        <p>But he did. There was no going back.</p>

        <p>
            Mikumo had never asked for this, he never asked for any of this. He
            never asked for the power of <em>All for One</em> thrumming in his
            veins. He never asked to wake up <em>ten years</em> in the past. He
            never asked to have to start over again and again and again.
        </p>

        <p>
            All the same, it had been his choice. He chose to study under the
            doctor, to trust that man. He chose to wander in spite of receiving
            an offer from the heroes. He chose to throw himself into danger for
            the chance of protecting his family and friends.
        </p>

        <p>&hellip; He didn&rsquo;t regret it.</p>

        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            The white haired teen continued to lay in the sun and relax for a
            few more hours, even managing to briefly fall asleep before instinct
            took back over to be on alert. After that, he summoned his latest
            notebook and began to sketch Inko and Izuku. Mikumo had to admit
            that he had been pretty cute as a child.
        </p>

        <p>
            As the sun began to hang lower in the sky, he stood up and
            stretched. Looking across the skyline, he broke out into a sprint.
            Claws digging into the stone below with experience in this terrain.
            His wings were still constrained under his shirt, but that
            didn&rsquo;t mean he couldn&rsquo;t still leap between the rooftops
            of Musutafu.
        </p>

        <p>
            He ran with no destination in mind. Total freedom as he soared
            through the air. The landmarks he had ingrained within his mind were
            warped, but still stood tall and recognizable. Like an echo of what
            once was. Broken, chipped, scoured, overgrown, and cracked buildings
            were all replaced with perfectly smooth concrete, steel, wood, and
            glass containing few imperfections.
        </p>

        <p>
            A few fights had broken out between heroes and villains as he made
            his way across rooftop after rooftop. He had paused each time to
            watch the fights below. It felt nice to write away theory after
            theory for the first time in so long, not to rip apart an enemy or
            theorize which quirks would work well together in a noumu, but just
            for the hell of it.
        </p>

        <p>
            He could already tell that his analysis skill had improved, despite
            his lack of actually recording his thoughts while hunting noumu. It
            was also likely aided by his understanding with quirks from
            <em>All for One</em>. All the quirks he currently possessed and the
            ones he briefly held while helping to create the noumu each had
            their own feeling of energy. Similar quirks tended to feel alike in
            some way. Function similarly too.
        </p>

        <p>
            Eventually, twilight hung over the city once more as Mikumo slowed
            in his aimless journey. He scrambled up the side of a higher
            building in the area he found himself in and perched on the
            customary railing for flat roofs before tipping forward to stand on
            the solid ground. He was getting lucky with the weather being so
            nice. Within seconds, he called forward a few blankets to cushion
            the ground and flopped down to sleep under the stars once more.
        </p>

        <p>Thankfully, no nightmares found him this time.</p>

        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            The next morning, the avian found himself strolling through the main
            entrance of Musutafu Library in a much lighter mood than before.
            Much more grounded than before. He was in the past, that was his
            reality now. So what? It wouldn&rsquo;t stop him from
            <em>living</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;Ah, Akatani! Good to see you again. I have those papers ready
            for you. Come.&rdquo; The librarian led him to a small office hidden
            in a small corner to the side of the main floor. Tokai walked around
            a desk and sat behind it while motioning Mikumo to take one of the
            seats in front of it.
        </p>

        <p>
            The office was quite inviting with warm and dark tones, plants that
            grew in various pots around the place on shelves holding various
            books and trinkets. Brass weaved through the space in various
            fixtures that seemed to only act as art and a dim source of light. A
            picture of a small girl with brown hair and wine red eyes sat on the
            desk itself.
        </p>

        <p>
            A small stack of papers hit the wooden desk, knocking him from his
            observations. &ldquo;Here you are, make sure you look through the
            information. Some of the details can be changed to better fit your
            own backstory, but it&rsquo;ll cost this time.&rdquo; Tokai paused
            before scrambling through his desk and pulling out a small stack of
            cards. &ldquo;Almost forgot the business cards, tell them Tokai sent
            you, and they might take you on.&rdquo; He smiled softly as Mikumo
            reached forwards. &ldquo;I wish you good luck moving forward,
            Akatani.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;Thank you, this is already so much more than I could have
            asked for. How could I repay you?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to repay me. I do this because I want
            to&hellip; My own daughter was in a similar situation. Authorities
            would just give her back to her abuser unless we changed her name
            and hid her in the records.&rdquo; Tokai sighed, &ldquo;I
            don&rsquo;t care what your story is, I could just tell you needed
            similar help.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>&ldquo;Still, thank you.&rdquo;</p>

        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            Mikumo stood before a small cafe, one that only locals in the know
            would ever be able to find. A large window allowed light to stream
            in, while the entrance was positioned to the side of the storefront.
            A fluffy black cat sat against the glass staring intently at him
            with vibrant yellow eyes, almost daring him to just enter already.
        </p>

        <p>
            Taking a deep breath, the young white haired man stepped through the
            entrance of Nekohana. This was the third location he&rsquo;s been to
            from the cards Tokai gave him. Each one had rejected him so far,
            even when he mentioned the librarian.
        </p>

        <p>
            Small seating areas dotted the space, some even as small cushions
            scattered across the floor. Cat trees, walkways, beds, and toys
            littered the space, providing a utopia for the adorable creatures.
            Across from the entrance, creating an L shape with the back and side
            wall, stood a bar and display case next to it showing off all sorts
            of sweet treats.
        </p>

        <p>
            Behind the display counter was an androgynous person with pale skin
            and deep black hair. Their eyes caught Mikumo&rsquo;s attention as
            large vibrant yellow irises were surrounded with pitch black sclera.
            The pupil seemed to be slit like a cat&rsquo;s too as their eyes
            narrowed on him.
        </p>

        <p>
            Their tired voice rang across the short space to where Mikumo had
            approached the counter, &ldquo;Welcome to Nekohana, what can I get
            for you today? Do mind that we&rsquo;re closing soon.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;Oh! Uh- I&rsquo;m looking for&hellip;&rdquo; Mikumo pulled
            the business card from his pocket again to double-check the name on
            it, &ldquo;Tamakawa?&rdquo; Good thing he decided to keep the cards
            on him rather than storing them inside the quirk.
        </p>

        <p>
            The barista slowly blinked at him before moving to a door in the
            back and knocking on it before opening it to yell, &ldquo;Hey, Tama!
            A kid&rsquo;s looking for you!&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            A bang came from the floor above before a minute later, a man stuck
            his face out and looked over at the teen. His voice was best
            described as gruff as he spoke, &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; His
            hair was a blue-gray, while his eyes were a striking light green. A
            fluffy tail the same color as the man&rsquo;s hair followed him as
            he stepped around the corner on cat-like legs and paws. &ldquo;What?
            Cat got your tongue?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            The man smiled as Mikumo sputtered for a second before being able to
            articulate words again, &ldquo;Are you Tamakawa?&rdquo; The cat-man
            briefly nodded. &ldquo;Well, uh, I heard from Tokai that you might
            be hiring?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            He hummed before rhetorically asking, &ldquo;Tomoki sent you, huh?
            Man&rsquo;s too kind for his own good. You&rsquo;re in luck. Hayami
            here could use some help running this place when I&rsquo;m not
            around.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            The barista, Hayami, yawned before jumping in, &ldquo;Rush hour is
            exhausting.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            Tamakawa scanned him before continuing, &ldquo;Although,
            you&rsquo;re clearly a street kid&hellip; Make sure you wash up
            before setting foot in here tomorrow, got it?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;Wait, just like that?&rdquo; he asked, dumbfounded. That was
            too easy after so many rejections in his life. He was already
            prepared to be looking for work for the next week. When has the
            world ever been this kind?
        </p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;Tomoki sent ya. He clearly saw something in you and deemed
            your character alright. He&rsquo;s good at reading people quickly.
            Show up at eight o&rsquo;clock sharp tomorrow morning,
            <em>clean</em>, and you can consider yourself hired.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;Thank you sir! I won&rsquo;t let you down!&rdquo; Mikumo
            smiled at the man, even as anxiety began to creep into his bones.
            Too much was going well for him the past few days. How long would
            his good luck last?
        </p>

        <p>
            Tamakawa smiled widely back at him, &ldquo;Make sure you
            don&rsquo;t. I look forward to working with you, ah-&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>&ldquo;Akatani Mikumo, sir.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Akatani.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>
            The barista spoke up again as the black cat from the window jumped
            onto his shoulders, &ldquo;Alright, I want to go home already. Cafe
            closed a few minutes ago. All the other cats are already
            asleep.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>&ldquo;Oh! Sorry&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

        <p>
            Yellow eyes glanced over at him, &ldquo;Nothing to apologize
            for.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            The cat seemed to disappear as Hayami left the front entrance.
            Tamakawa soon spoke up, &ldquo;Well, are you going to get out of
            here and sleep wherever you hole up or what?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;Ah, sorry. Yeah, I&rsquo;ll head out. Thank you again,
            Tamakawa.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sweat it, kid.&rdquo; The man paused before
            closing the door to the upstairs, &ldquo;How old are you
            anyway?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>&ldquo;Eighteen.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>
            Tamakawa smirked with a hint of mischief in his eyes, &ldquo;Still a
            kid, then.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            The moon shone brightly over head, not as bright as it could be as
            it waned. Mikumo sat atop the cafe&rsquo;s roof as he read. He had
            grabbed a few books pertaining to quirk science and the stars. Even
            after everything with the Good Doctor, he still found himself drawn
            to quirks. Maybe it was a side effect of <em>All for One</em>, maybe
            it was just who he was. He would never know now.
        </p>

        <p>
            A gust picked up and flipped through the pages of the book in his
            lap. Despite the April chill, he didn&rsquo;t feel cold. With his
            place lost, he dismissed the book to within <em>Pocket</em> and took
            off the shirt and jacket he took a few days ago to stretch his
            wings. Soreness and relief were felt hand in hand as he realized he
            should have done that sooner.
        </p>

        <p>
            Tomorrow was truly his new start. He would have purpose again,
            instead of just wandering the city without aim. Tomorrow he would
            have to return to Takoba to find some new clothes and wash up as
            best he could. If he remembered right, there was a pile far from any
            rotting substances that would be clean enough to wear.
        </p>

        <p>Tomorrow was a new day.</p>

                Why did I decide to have an <em>All for One</em> user?! Not to
                mention letting him take a bunch of quirks just before the time
                travel. I’m still finalizing what his new list of quirks are
                after that stunt. Don’t know what I’m referencing? It’s in

                If any of you have ideas for quirks that you’d love to see
                written, feel free to sacrifice them to me and I might include
                it. Also, OCs, dear god, I need so many to fill the world even
                if they only show up once. The world is alive beyond canon!

                Fun Fact: <br />“Cat Flower Garden” in Taiwan was the first cat
                cafe ever in 1998. Nekohana uses neko for cat and hana for
                flower as a nod to history.
