        <b>Saturday, May 19, 2136</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        A little girl stared at him with endless excitement in her pale green
        gaze. Chestnut brown hair covered her head and came down in messy bangs.
        It was the same girl who had excitedly talked with him about quirks a
        few weeks ago. Her mother stood a bit away, looking a little embarrassed
        once more.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mikumo flashed her a comforting smile before turning to the child with a
        soft, friendly tone, &ldquo;Hello again.&rdquo; She must have been about
        the same age as Kouta was.
    </p>
    <p>
        &ldquo;Hi, Mister! Mama said I should apologize for asking so many
        questions about your mutations last time. Sorry.&rdquo; She bowed
        briefly before beginning again, &ldquo;Today I wanted to share my quirk
        instead to make it up for last time! Do you want to talk about it,
        Mister?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
        Warmth blossomed in his chest and he genuinely grinned, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
        love to!&rdquo; He walked over to the bar and motioned for her to sit in
        one of the stools.
    </p>
    <p>
        Her mother quickly followed suit as well. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to
        humor her if you don&rsquo;t want to. My husband and son have a love for
        quirks, and she seems to have picked it up too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
        Now that made him wish to meet the rest of this family, &ldquo;Nonsense.
        I love quirks! I&rsquo;m not just humoring her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>&ldquo;A-are you sure?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>
        The girl called for his attention again, &ldquo;Mister! What&rsquo;s
        your name? Mine&rsquo;s Akina.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>&ldquo;Mikumo.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>
        &ldquo;Mister Mikumo, my quirk is called Flower Crown! I can grow copies
        of flowers in my hair. It&rsquo;s not as cool as my brother&rsquo;s
        quirk, though.&rdquo; Akina slightly pouted.
    </p>
    <p>
        He couldn&rsquo;t allow that to continue, &ldquo;Hey, none of that.
        Every quirk is special in its own way. I&rsquo;m sure Flower Crown can
        do something amazing that you just haven&rsquo;t discovered yet! What
        kinds of flowers can you make? Is there a limit to how many you can grow
        in a day?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
        &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve been able to grow every flower I&rsquo;ve
        touched so far, and I don&rsquo;t know how many I can make in a
        day&hellip; I haven&rsquo;t tried counting&hellip; Was I supposed to
        count them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, no. That&rsquo;s fine that you don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; It
        was so easy to forget that other people didn&rsquo;t question all the
        different limits of quirks. Especially children. Though, it wasn&rsquo;t
        like they were expected to know everything about their quirks.
        &ldquo;Although you said copy earlier and that you touched the flowers
        before growing them? You have to touch a flower to grow that
        type?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
        &ldquo;Yeah! Each time I touch a flower, I can grow a copy of it from my
        hair for a few hours after that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>&ldquo;Is it any plant or just flowers?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only tried flowers.&rdquo; she gasped, &ldquo;Mama!
        What if I can grow anything like you?!&rdquo; The pale blond woman
        looked exasperated as her daughter shook her vigorously.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mikumo pondered on it. If the woman was able to grow anything, not just
        flowers, then it would be very likely that Akira would have the same
        restriction. It wasn&rsquo;t guaranteed, though. Sometimes a quirk would
        become stronger in one area while weakening in another as it passed
        through the generations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Wasn&rsquo;t a tomato technically a flower? He quickly said, &ldquo;Give
        me a second.&rdquo; as he turned to see if Tamakawa had any spare
        tomatoes stored within the kitchen. Luckily, he was able to locate one
        in no time. Unluckily, someone came in to get a coffee while he was
        looking and had to quickly tend to that for a few minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
        He had placed the tomato in front of Akina before dealing with the
        customer, so by the time his attention went back to what she was doing,
        small tomatoes sat in her hair. She seemed to vibrate in excitement,
        &ldquo;Mama, Mama, look, I can grow fruit!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s amazing sweetie.&rdquo; The woman scooped her
        daughter into a hug, &ldquo;You were always amazing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
        Mikumo made his way back to stand in front of the bar and lean on it,
        &ldquo;Mister Mikumo, look!&rdquo; She took a few of the tomatoes from
        her hair and held them out to him.
    </p>
    <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so cool!&rdquo; Without thinking, he summoned his
        red notebook in a flicker of pink light. Mumbling as he wrote,
        &ldquo;<em
            >Does the quirk use the user&rsquo;s stamina, or is it resource
            based for creating plants? Is there a limit on how many plants they
            can copy&mdash;</em
        >&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
        &ldquo;Whoa, is that your quirk?&rdquo; <em>One of them</em>. The girl
        started at him with figurative stars in her eyes. Before he could try to
        answer, she bulldozed on, &ldquo;You just brought that book out of thin
        air! How did you do that? Was it teleportation? That&rsquo;s so rare!
        Can you teleport anything?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>He blinked. Was this what he was like to other people?</p>
    <p>
        Either way, being asked what his quirk was for the first time made him
        think about <em>All for One</em>. That was his quirk, his actual one.
        Beyond the basics, he found that he didn&rsquo;t understand his own
        quirk at all. He didn&rsquo;t know his limits beyond transfer overuse
        and the repercussions of mutation quirks. The realization hit him like a
        truck.
    </p>
    <p>
        Even with his newfound turmoil, he responded, &ldquo;I call it Pocket.
        It lets me store things within a pocket dimension. So, it&rsquo;s not
        really teleportation?&rdquo; Not like he could tell anyone about his
        real quirk, much less a child he&rsquo;s only met twice.
    </p>
    <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s still so cool. What&rsquo;s the coolest thing you
        have in it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
        He didn&rsquo;t have anything she might think is cool&hellip; All he
        really had on him was his bo staff, notebooks, pencils, blankets,
        clothes, knives, and yen. The knives were probably what most people
        would call cool but showing off his short swords that were chipped and
        stained with blood from heavy use to a child? No.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thankfully, Akina&rsquo;s mother spoke up, &ldquo;Akina, it&rsquo;s time
        to go. We need to make it back to the store in time to open.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>She pouted, &ldquo;Aww, Mama, do we really have to go?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>
        &ldquo;I have to open the shop.&rdquo; She picked the girl up off the
        stool, &ldquo;Besides, we can&rsquo;t sell any flowers if we
        aren&rsquo;t there to do so. Come on.&rdquo; Akina stood as the woman
        placed her down on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
        Following her mother out, the small girl turned before leaving,
        &ldquo;Bye Mister Mikumo!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
        &ldquo;Bye.&rdquo; He waved as he watched them both leave and disappear
        out of sight. Sighing, Mikumo stared at the miniature black hole in his
        palm. While she hadn&rsquo;t meant to, Akina gave him a lot to think
        about.
    </p>

    <br />
    <hr />
    <br />

    <p>
        Mikumo found himself sitting on the sands of Takoba Beach as the sun set
        on the horizon behind Musutafu and dark clouds rolled in over the sea.
        He had stopped coming by the beach except for collecting scrap to use
        once he fixed up the apartment a few weeks ago.
    </p>
    <p>
        After a lot of reflection, he realized that over the past month he had
        lapsed into only using the quirks he had collected before fighting All
        for One. Refusing to even think about the transfer abilities his quirk
        possessed. Not only that, he had begun repressing any thought about his
        dreamscape and the new quirks from the fight. All of it had been
        subconscious.
    </p>
    <p>
        The dreamscape had been one aspect of his quirk that he hadn&rsquo;t
        minded, spending a lot of time molding into a second home. It was a
        reflection of Takoba Beach while he had lived there. Cleaned of all the
        trash now sitting around him once more. The broken buildings of Musutafu
        stood below the galaxy that truly represented his quirk within the
        space.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before that god-damn fight, he had been ready to start accepting the
        full capabilities of what he could do. He had told Kaachan and the
        others the true name and nature of his quirk. Laid bare that he was just
        like the Demon King and believed that maybe he could use
        <em>All for One</em> for good.
    </p>
    <p><em>And he did.</em></p>
    <p>
        He took quirks from the man once named He Who Takes. Mikumo stole from
        the one who steals <em>and it hurt</em>. The transfer had ended with a
        crack of blinding white across the fake sky and debilitating pain that
        made even the century old man stumble to his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
        His eyes refocused and looked out across the water. With the sun fully
        set and the clouds blocking out the moonlight, the sea looked pitch
        black. Like black ink. A wave crashed on the shore, threatening to erode
        it away. A deep voice sounded in his ears,
        <em>&ldquo;Stop resisting.&rdquo;</em> The water was going to reach up
        into the sky like a tsunami. The wave was going to drown him. It
        wouldn&rsquo;t take long to be washed away.
    </p>
    <p>
        He breathed, and the smell of trash grounded him. This wasn&rsquo;t the
        beach in his mind nor the one he had called home. There was no wave
        coming. He had already survived it.
    </p>

    <br />
    <hr />
    <br />

    <p>
        Standing within the safety of his apartment, emerald green eyes stared
        into the star shaped pupils of his own reflection. The mirror had been
        abandoned in the living room when he first claimed the place. It
        didn&rsquo;t take much to hang it on the wall where it belonged. Late
        morning sunlight streamed in from the balcony window to his side.
    </p>
    <p>
        Taking a deep breath, Mikumo called upon <em>All for One</em> itself.
        Glowing cyan and black energy began to swirl around him. The exact shade
        was hard to name but definitely a mix between light blue and green.
        Maybe a bright teal or turquoise.
    </p>
    <p>
        Looking back to his reflection, his eyes widened in surprise. The same
        shade of blue-green glowed from his irises. Letting go of his quirk, he
        watched as the energy surrounding him retreated under his skin and the
        glow in his eyes dimmed back to his natural color.
    </p>
    <p>
        The next thing he wanted to see was something he had only noticed a few
        times before. Urging his quirk to bring forward <em>Blink</em>,
        <em>Pocket</em>, <em>Nyoom</em>, <em>Taser</em>, <em>Freeze</em>, and
        <em>Strength</em>. The six quirks hummed more vibrantly under his skin.
        Their power surging compared to the normal faint buzz he was used to.
    </p>
    <p>
        Small arcs of black and teal lightning bounced around and flickered off
        his skin. The black core of each bolt only added to how dangerous he
        looked. The faint glow in his eyes furthered the effect.
    </p>
    <p>
        Kind of having fun, he summoned his two short swords to each hand and
        dropped into a battle stance with his clawed feet spread and wings
        slightly fanned out behind him. He smiled widely in a way that would
        emphasize his large canines from <em>Fangs</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Yeah, he would not want to meet himself in a dark back alley. The
        villains he scared off after The Fall were lucky he didn&rsquo;t have
        <em>Fangs</em> yet, nor knew that <em>All for One</em> had black
        lightning and made his eyes glow when he used several quirks at once.
    </p>
    <p>Maybe Hayami was starting to rub off on him.</p>
    <p>
        After writing down his observations in the black notebook he had
        reserved for <em>All for One</em> years ago, he mentally prepared
        himself for what he wanted to do today. It was Sunday, so he had all day
        to himself for this. He needed to reclaim his dreamscape.
    </p>
    <p>
        Getting himself comfy within the living room in the veritable
        <em>nest</em> of blankets he had found or bought, he closed his eyes and
        tried his best to dispel all other thoughts and anxiety. His breathing
        slowed into a controlled rhythm before he tried to tug on the feeling he
        could remember from when each transfer unwillingly dragged him in.
    </p>
    <p>
        Awareness of the world around him faded away as he fell into the dream.
        The mutations he grew accustomed to fell away within the space, his back
        bare of his wings, his legs no longer animal like, and his teeth duller.
        He supposed it was his true form. What he would look like if
        <em>All for One</em> was the only quirk he held. He opened his eyes to
        the sight of Takoba Beach.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mikumo breathed in, then out. Everything was only a dream, no matter how
        real it could feel. He was in control.
        <strike>He almost drowned last time.</strike> This was his domain. He
        just had to stay calm.
    </p>
    <p>
        The broken skyline of Musutafu faced him as a black hole hung low in the
        sky. Over a dozen colors spun around it at dizzying speeds around the
        event horizon. Each one was a quirk, represented as a little ball of
        light. He didn&rsquo;t dare to turn around and look at the sea behind
        him. Nothing would be there anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
        Digging his toes into the sand, Mikumo considered what he wanted this
        space to look like. It had been easier to mold it into a place that held
        significance to him than of a fantasy. In the early days of trying to
        command this realm, he had tried to recreate how he imagined the layout
        of Might Tower. It never stayed for long.
    </p>
    <p>
        To begin, he imagined the landscape around him fading away back to the
        blank slate it had been before. Back to how it was when he first
        manifested <em>All for One</em>. He captured that image and exerted his
        will upon the realm, watching as the buildings flaked away&hellip;
    </p>
    <p><em>Like dust</em>.</p>
    <p>The dreamscape flickered.</p>
    <p>
        He leaned against the railing trying to see his home that resided at the
        base of the mountain on the horizon, underneath Jaku General Hospital.
        Flakes of dust drifted through the air. A giant crater that extended
        deep into the earth where the hospital used to be and several
        surrounding city blocks greeted him. All of it had been turned to dust.
        <em>His home was turned to dust.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        He continued to stare at where his home used to be. The only things he
        had left were whatever he had on him and had stored within
        <em>Pocket</em>, his notebooks and the clothes on his back&hellip; He
        wasn&rsquo;t alone on the roof. A homeless looking hero, Eraserhead,
        grabbed his attention as he said, &ldquo;Yami.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p><em>That wasn&rsquo;t his name anymore.</em></p>
    <p>The dreamscape flickered.</p>
    <p>Something was wrong.</p>
    <p>No, nothing was wrong.</p>
    <p>He watched as the buildings flaked away <em>like stardust</em>.</p>
    <p>
        Mikumo took back control of the dream from the memory. He sighed, so
        much for staying calm and in control. The entire dreamscape seemed to
        shudder as the combined skyline of Jaku and Musutafu crumbled away. This
        time into glimmering stardust as he willed it to be.
    </p>
    <p>
        All that was left was a blank void as stars meandered in the sky above
        him. Well, and a stack of notebooks and other things stored within
        <em>Pocket</em> nearby&hellip; Teal pulsed within the static that made
        up the firmament of the dreamscape as he commanded it to change once
        again.
    </p>
    <p>
        The black hole from before reformed in the sky as the stars began to
        spin around it once more. <em>All for One</em> actually didn&rsquo;t
        have its own star. It was strange. It felt as if the quirk as simply an
        extension of himself and the dream landscape. The black hole murmured in
        time with his own thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
        A yawn escaped him from how mentally taxing controlling and changing the
        realm was. The fake floor that both was and wasn&rsquo;t there below him
        shifted into stone as he brought forward the memory of the roof of his
        current apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
        The roof was barren of anything he had actually built or set up within
        the real world counterpart, but that was alright. It had been that way
        with Takoba too. The difference made it easier to tell when he was
        dreaming anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
        He could always change how the dreamscape looked again at a later time.
        While the home he carved on the beach would always hold a special place
        in his heart, he wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to see the sea in his
        dreams the same again.
    </p>
    <p>Exhausted, he let the dream fade away as real sleep claimed him.</p>

    <br />
    <hr />
    <br />

    <p>
        Near the edges of Musutafu exists a park not many people know about. The
        trees are thick and plants grow freely outside the paths made by those
        who frequent the woodland. A small creek runs through part of the
        semi-fenced in land. There&rsquo;s one spot where a large tree fell
        across the creek and now serves as a sturdy and dry path for those who
        dare cross deeper into the woods.
    </p>
    <p>
        A white haired man sat on the log with his clawed feet dangling over the
        water just above the surface. His brother had come here a lot when they
        were younger. Mikumo had always been right on his heels. Maybe he should
        be more worried about a certain pair of children running into him, but
        he couldn&rsquo;t care less under the light of the moon.
    </p>
    <p>
        The relative remoteness yet proximity of Keimei Creek to his new home
        made it the perfect place to practice the quirks he didn&rsquo;t fully
        understand yet. Or to just experiment with them. There was one thing he
        hadn&rsquo;t tried yet that he had brought up with Kacchan right after
        revealing his quirk; Using <em>Freeze</em> as an ice breath ability
        similar to Hisashi&rsquo;s <em>Fire Breath</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Tugging on it, Mikumo took a deep breath before activating the quirk as
        he exhaled. Vapor within his breath quickly froze into fog and fell like
        little flakes of snow before it melted. Well, that was promising.
        Actually, there was a chance one of his new quirks was wind based. It
        felt similar to <em>Air Cannon</em>, after all.
    </p>
    <p>
        One would think he would have learned much earlier on to not charge head
        first into things, but here the young <em>All for One</em> user was
        activating an unknown quirk near full strength. Mikumo yelped as a
        strong gale knocked him fully off the log, several feet though the air,
        and into the creek below.
    </p>
    <p>At least he had his answer about it being a wind quirk.</p>
    <p>
        Climbing back onto the bank, Mikumo shook his speckled wings, trying to
        dispel the water. Ugh, wet feathers was the worst feeling when he
        wasn&rsquo;t mentally prepared for it. Trying to use the quirk again, he
        summoned a faint breeze before increasing its strength and directing it
        to dry him off quicker.
    </p>
    <p>
        Several minutes later, he stood on the log over the creek again.
        Determination in his eyes and excitement in his bones. This time, when
        he exhaled, he tried to direct the wind quirk into enhancing the small
        gust created by his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
        It was shaky and unrefined, but he watched as the air created large
        ripples in the water below. Mikumo grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally combining the two quirks together, a vortex of freezing air
        spawned seemingly from his breath. The surface of the creek froze into
        ice as arctic winds passed over it. He could already think of so many
        ways these two quirks could be used together, beyond mimicking his
        father&rsquo;s quirk with ice.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mikumo summoned a light gust to swirl around him, while cooling the air
        to frigid temperatures. <em>Breeze</em> was the perfect quirk to enhance
        and pair with <em>Freeze</em>. Frost coated nearly every surface
        surrounding him as he expanded and strengthened Polar Vortex.
