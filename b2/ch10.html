        <p>
            Mikumo crouched on the edge of a building, watching as the sun
            slowly rose over the ocean to the east. Reds and blues and pinks and
            purples, all highlighted by stunning gold. He yawned widely in the
            morning air. Thankfully, he had been getting better about biting
            himself with his new teeth. He had only gotten <em>Fangs</em> a few
            months ago.
        </p>
        <p>
            Actually, since the mutation quirk was on his mind, he never named
            the avian mutation quirk, did he? Should he just call it
            <em>Wings</em> and be done with it, or something better? The quirk
            wasn&rsquo;t just the tiny wings barely longer than his arms but had
            also given him animalistic legs and feet structured somewhere
            between talons and paws. He could decide on a name later.
        </p>
        <p>
            Taking out his phone from <em>Pocket</em>, he took a picture of the
            colorful sight and sent it off to Ruka. No two mornings were ever
            completely alike. Today was the dawn of a possible new chapter in
            his life.
        </p>
        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />
        <p>
            &ldquo;I want to know more about what Tokai would want me to do.
            It&rsquo;s about helping other people out of tough situations,
            right?&rdquo; Emerald green eyes stared down the navy blue cat
            hybrid as the man turned to meet his gaze.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tamakawa sighed, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that much about his side
            job. Plausible deniability and all that. You&rsquo;ll have to speak
            to him yourself to know more.&rdquo; Mikumo blinked, he thought that
            maybe he could give him at least something to go off of.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even still, he wasn&rsquo;t discouraged, &ldquo;How and when should
            I contact him?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Just visit the library.&rdquo; He paused as his tail flicked,
            seemingly in thought, &ldquo;What I do know is that Tomoki deals a
            lot in information. He has at least a few people with eyes and ears
            on the ground reporting to him. I&rsquo;ve gotten a few hints over
            the years that he might have some more people that pitch in when
            fights break out. I&rsquo;m not sure if they just work alongside him
            or what.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite thinking over Tamakawa&rsquo;s words on behalf of the
            librarian for about a week, Mikumo found himself pausing once again.
            It was starting to sound like Tokai led a small faction in the
            underground. Did he really want to get wrapped up in something like
            that again?
        </p>
        <p>
            At the same time, this was different. Tokai claimed to just want to
            help those who only needed a hand up. The man had gifted him a new
            identity with very few questions asked. Granted him the opportunity
            to get on his feet and act like a normal civilian within only a few
            days after waking up a decade before the fight that sent him here.
        </p>
        <p>
            He would give him a chance. A chance to prove that his intentions
            are true. That helping people was the core of whatever group Tokai
            had fostered. After all, Mikumo had been ready to give another group
            a chance only several weeks ago.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once upon a time, helping people had been his dream. Maybe it
            wasn&rsquo;t as dead as he thought.
        </p>
        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />
        <p>
            The cafe lulled in business in the later morning before noon. With
            nothing better to do and plenty of time to stave off his nerves
            about the future, he brought his phone out and hunted the cats of
            Nekohana. Hayami slightly teased him about how it should be cats
            hunting birds, not the other way around. That earned a light smack
            with his wing.
        </p>
        <p>
            After he captured a few pictures of the cats Mikumo hummed to
            himself, Aizawa liked cats, right?

        <br />
        <p>
            The avian stared up at the top of Musutafu&rsquo;s main library.
            Mikumo ducked his head down as determination filled his gaze and
            took a step forward. He would help and protect others. In another
            time, he had been called Tengu due to his diligence in protecting
            his corner of the city.
        </p>
        <p>
            The librarian from before spotted him from behind the kiosk in the
            center of the building. He seemed to excuse himself to his coworker
            before meeting Mikumo halfway. &ldquo;Ah, good to see you again,
            Akatani.&rdquo; he greeted.
        </p>
        <p>
            Slightly bowing, he returned, &ldquo;Likewise. Tamakawa sent me your
            way this time.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            The smile on his face slipped into something slightly more genuine
            from the more service-like expression he had before, &ldquo;Ah,
            good! Please, let&rsquo;s discuss in my office.&rdquo; Mikumo only
            nodded and followed him to the room Tokai had led him to once
            before. They both took a seat around the ornate desk before Tokai
            spoke up again, &ldquo;So, I heard that you do quirk analysis as a
            hobby. Would you be interested in acting as a quirk
            counselor?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Mikumo blinked, &ldquo;<em>What?</em>&rdquo; Out of everything he
            thought Tokai might ask him to do, that was not it.
        </p>
        <p>
            The pink haired man steepled his hands and leaned forward,
            &ldquo;There are plenty of kids around here that can&rsquo;t afford
            quirk counseling that quite honestly need it.&rdquo; His gaze
            hardened before continuing, &ldquo;Some parents even refuse to bring
            them in for counseling because they hate the quirk their child was
            born with.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;S-so you just want me to do analysis for people who need help
            with their quirks?&rdquo; Tokai nodded. &ldquo;To be honest, I
            thought you were going to ask that I gather information or something
            with all the hints that you&rsquo;re involved with the underground.
            If you don&rsquo;t mind, what the deal with that anyway?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            He smiled widely as he answered, &ldquo;Well, I admit that
            I&rsquo;ve been very honest around you since I could tell you might
            become a good ally if you were to be interested in this line of
            work. I&rsquo;m not as careless about that information as I might
            seem. As for why I&rsquo;m doing all this, cashing in favors to help
            out the community seems like a good use of my resources, no?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh. Although, why me?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;When you spend years as a keeper of knowledge, you tend to
            pick up skills to read situations and people very well. Choosing a
            poor business partner can lead to capture or even death. I can tell
            you&rsquo;ve been involved in the underground before. The way you
            carry yourself says a lot. You&rsquo;ve seen the darkness of society
            and still wish to hide in the shadows.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            He was silent for a moment, &ldquo;You could tell that just by
            looking at me the first time?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;You also wear your heart on your sleeve. Did it even occur to
            you to try lying to me?&rdquo; Tokai chuckled. &ldquo;Be more
            careful in the future, or you&rsquo;ll become a liability one day.
            Ah, I can work out lessons on handling the underground as part of
            your payment if you wish.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Payment? I thought you asked me here to repay for the
            ID.&rdquo; Mikumo admitted.
        </p>
        <p>
            The man clapped his hands once, loudly, &ldquo;Alright first lesson,
            what did you just do? I won&rsquo;t have you potentially working
            with me this poorly. As for the ID, you&rsquo;ve always had my word
            that there were no strings attached. This is a new deal.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            He stared wide-eyed at the man before he started to think over the
            entire conversation. This is a deal, one that the librarian wants
            him to accept. A deal that had already begun in hopes to win him
            over. The man wants him to offer his knowledge on quirks. He&rsquo;s
            trying to bargain for that right now. Mikumo acknowledged, &ldquo;I
            let you know you could buy my time and knowledge for free in the
            middle of negotiations.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Leaning back in his chair, Tokai smirked, &ldquo;Ah, good. You
            picked that up quick. I&rsquo;ll teach you more about how to
            properly hold yourself as long as you help out some of my clients
            with your expertise on quirks.&rdquo; He seemed to hum to himself,
            &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll even add on a course for a quirk counseling
            license.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Rather than asking him this time, Mikumo shelved the question of why
            Tokai would give him a license for future consideration. Well, that
            question also warranted asking why Tokai was even this invested in
            him. What did the man truly want from him? What did he know?
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;I can see you&rsquo;re thinking hard this time rather than
            blurting the question out. You need to school your expressions more
            in the future. Anyway, is this deal agreeable to you?&rdquo; The
            pink haired man raised an eyebrow.
        </p>
        <p>
            Deciding to clarify the agreement, he asked, &ldquo;I act as a quirk
            counselor for your clients in exchange for information and a quirk
            counseling license?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Light yellow eyes seemed to light up in mild
            excitement. Tokai extended out his right hand across the desk.
        </p>
        <p>Mikumo took it, &ldquo;Then I accept.&rdquo;</p>
        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />
        <p>
            Ruka sighed from across the counter, &ldquo;How did you make it
            through high school? There&rsquo;s so much homework! It&rsquo;s
            exhausting.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Mikumo huffed, &ldquo;I was basically homeschooled.&rdquo; Aldera
            Junior High had sucked. The other kids liked to trip him or steal
            his homework. Sometimes they chased him, promising to only rough him
            up a little. The teachers all encouraged it. He didn&rsquo;t want to
            imagine what Aldera High would have been like.
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;What! What was that like?&rdquo; The laboratory. The Doctor.
            His home and the man he was so close to seeing like a father after
            taking him in. A trust long broken came to light as the place fell
            apart.
        </p>
        <p>
            Oh, the things that man taught him. The things that man had done to
            him.
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Lonely. I didn&rsquo;t have many friends before, but I found
            myself missing my old best friend, no matter how much of an asshole
            he was.&rdquo; He chuckled, &ldquo;We met a couple of years later,
            and he apologized. It was nice to see that he finally matured during
            high school.&rdquo; He paused before adding, &ldquo;We grew up
            together, we were practically brothers. I&rsquo;m not sure if I
            could have fully forgiven anyone else.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            When he looked back up, Ruka was staring at him with wide eyes,
            &ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s the most you&rsquo;ve talked about
            anything from before we met.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            He rubbed at the back of his neck and looked away for a moment,
            &ldquo;Yeah, I guess it is.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Got anything else to share?&rdquo; she smiled slyly. He
            chuckled. She continued, &ldquo;Were you taught anything extra from
            the normal curriculum?&rdquo; Mikumo paused. Ah.

            &ldquo;W-well, I&rsquo;m not sure if my, uh, mentor even gave me the
            normal curriculum&hellip;&rdquo; he admitted. The Doctor seemed like
            he wanted him to be highly educated, at least, but did that man give
            him the full education he would have had without him? &ldquo;He was
            very focused on his own studies and wanted me as his
            assistant.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Ruka tilted her head to the side, &ldquo;What did you study?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Quirk factors and genealogy. He reached out to me after I
            read several of his papers and reports.&rdquo; Actually, that should
            have been a red flag for all that eventually transpired afterward.
            Alas, fourteen-year-old him didn&rsquo;t know better and was too
            emotional to really care if he was honest.
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;That&rsquo;s actually really cool! Did you look into the
            quirkless at all? What makes quirkless people so different?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            That question caught him off guard but just made him more excited,
            &ldquo;Yeah! I had started by looking into the Dawn of Quirks
            because I wanted to see what scientist back then thought about
            meta-humans.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;Meta-humans?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Old term for quirked people. Anyway, what I found is that by
            Pre-Quirk definitions, almost everyone is a meta-human! For example,
            your blue hair would have been classified as a quirk in the first
            generation. Over time, vestigial mutations became more common and
            things like hair or eye color were no longer counted as
            quirks.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;<em>What?</em>&rdquo; She looked like part of her worldview
            was breaking. Not too far off from how he had felt learning that.
            &ldquo;Wait, what color were people's hair and eyes normally,
            then?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Apparently their eyes were either shades of brown, blue, or
            green. Their hair was black, brown, red, or blond. In lower quirked
            population countries, these are still the most common colors
            today.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;That&rsquo;s wild. Although, you called them mutations. What
            does that mean for mutant quirks?&rdquo; she asked.
        </p>
        <p>
            He giggled, &ldquo;Under current guidelines it's possible for
            someone without a manifested quirk, someone quirkless, to be
            registered with a mutation class quirk if they inherit an obvious
            vestigial mutation like, say, scales.&rdquo; Mikumo sighed before he
            continued, &ldquo;Mutation class quirks are the most confusing to
            properly classify.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;Wait, <em>what</em>?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Yeah, I think I wanted to look into all that more
            before&hellip;&rdquo; Before Garaki Kyuudai messed with his mind and
            body. Before the man used him as an experiment. He looked at the
            black dot in the center of one of his palms, &ldquo;Before things
            happened, and I forgot about it until now.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;I mean, how can you tell the difference between a vestigial
            mutation and a quirked mutation? Is that possible?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            He grinned, &ldquo;I kind of want to find out one day.&rdquo; Beyond
            <em>All for One</em>, of course.
        </p>
        <p>
            While Mikumo wasn&rsquo;t sure if he should even take back up quirk
            science, this conversation had reignited his desire to learn more
            about quirks. Not just analyzing them, but understanding how they
            manifest.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although, how different would he be from his old master if he
            pursued such studies again? Nightmarish creatures artificially
            created from dozens of drugs and substances came to mind. Where
            would he draw the line?
        </p>
        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />
        <p>
            Wind kicked around the forest of Keimei Creek. The whirlwinds of
            previous nights had tapered out into a light breeze that barely
            kicked up any leaves. A small clearing was still the epicenter of
            the abnormal activity and was where a man with multiple quirks sat
            with his eyes closed in concentration. <em>All for One</em> hummed
            in his bones, like always, as he used an interesting mechanic only
            discovered a few nights ago on a whim.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Sensing</em> was the new name of a quirk that proved to be
            passive in nature. It boosted his sense of sight, smell, and
            hearing. Touch and taste were likely affected too, but he
            couldn&rsquo;t tell the difference as easily. It was still up to his
            mind to make sense of the signals. A boosted sense of smell
            didn&rsquo;t mean he knew what the smell was, just that he could
            pick out fainter scents that maybe other people couldn&rsquo;t.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyway, in a moment of what could only be pure sleep-deprived
            nonsense, he smashed <em>Sensing</em> and <em>Breeze</em> together.
            No hesitation from the moment the thought manifested to doing it.
            His quirk reacted in kind by intertwining the two energies together.
            <em>Breeze</em> and <em>Sensing</em> still existed, they were just
            wrapped around each other and acted like one singular quirk. Two
            colors swirled within a star in his dreamscape.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following morning, he had made sure he could separate them. It
            had been a bit difficult, way harder than it had been to combine
            them, but possible. Interesting.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although, he had to sigh at how he still hadn&rsquo;t even touched a
            few of the quirks he had, yet managed to make a new one. His mind
            had also decided to remind him that he used to be fucking
            <em>quirkless</em>. How was this his life?
        </p>
        <p>
            Back to the matter at hand, since <em>Sensing</em> was passive and
            still functioned normally when combined with <em>Breeze</em>, he
            left them tangled together. However, <em>Breeze</em> had a new
            function. He could <em>feel</em> the wind he controlled. Finally, he
            could tell when he was hitting something without seeing it.
        </p>
        <p>
            His control of <em>Breeze</em> was getting better each night by
            leaps and bounds. Even his thought only control. Getting used to the
            new sensations was another matter.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mikumo could make out the texture of bark on the trees if he tried
            hard enough, but at other times he could barely tell if he was
            passing a large branch or tiny twig. Not to mention when he had
            tried to cast his attention to a large swath of the forest. It was
            so much. That experiment left him with a migraine for the rest of
            the night, as well as feeling disorientated and overwhelmed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tonight, he put all his attention onto what he could sense in the
            wind. The experience was similar to how he accessed the dreamscape,
            which made sense since that was how he was approaching it. He was
            only faintly aware of his own body, while his mind solely focused on
            <em>Wind Sense</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            It became a game to keep track of a few leaves that he picked up and
            make sure he didn&rsquo;t drop them as he directed the zephyr under
            the light of the full moon.

            Shouta interrupted her from messing with the barista they all took a
            slight liking to, &ldquo;Stop terrorizing who ever it is
            you&rsquo;re messaging.&rdquo; Nemuri pouted. He knew her so well.
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with a little bit of fun before
            <em>another</em> debrief meeting. I&rsquo;m starting to get sick of
            all these meetings about our next steps. Where&rsquo;s the
            <em>action</em>?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            The man sighed, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re on a strike team, Nem. Remember
            that. We can&rsquo;t just attack on a whim. We only have one shot at
            this.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            She huffed, &ldquo;Yeah, yeah. I <em>know</em>. Doesn&rsquo;t mean I
            can&rsquo;t be bored. I can&rsquo;t wait to have some tough guys all
            wrapped up for me.&rdquo; Nemuri smirked, &ldquo;All begging for
            release. Promising to be such good boys from now on.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Shouta only slowly exhaled another long sigh. She loved being the
            bane of his existence sometimes.

        <p><em>It really hadn&rsquo;t been planned.</em></p>
        <p>
            Jumping between buildings had quickly become an almost nightly
            occurrence. He just had so much restless energy. Besides, it was
            good practice in incorporating <em>Wind Sense</em> into his
            movements. He didn&rsquo;t need to see a gap to know it was there
            anymore. The technique was still at a level where he wouldn&rsquo;t
            run around blindfolded, though.
        </p>
        <p>
            Well, maybe not <em>yet</em>. Surely this skill could be practiced
            until he could do that. Wouldn&rsquo;t that be cool? A nagging
            thought in his mind reminded him that he shouldn&rsquo;t focus so
            much on only a few quirks. What if one day he needs to use one and
            is too rusty to properly use it? It nearly happened before.
        </p>
        <p>
            While he knew he very well <em>shouldn&rsquo;t</em>, Mikumo used a
            low output of <em>Kinetic Booster</em> to increase his speed while
            he ran. It was practically invisible under his skin anyway. Only
            noticeable by the buzz in his veins. Besides, this quirk could do
            well for practicing with controlling power output. Especially when
            it came to enhancers.
        </p>
        <p>
            After a while, he slowed down and sat on the edge of a tall
            building. He had been thinking more and more about
            <em>his</em> time. Yes, he made a home here, he has a life here now,
            but he still mourns for everything he had gone through to get here.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anxiety had been a constant in his life, before it had been just
            trying to get through the day when almost everyone knew he was
            quirkless. Never knowing when someone would jeer at him or even
            attack him for something he couldn&rsquo;t control. Now it was the
            dull fear of people wanting to control or kill him for the quirk
            that had been forced upon him.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the reprieve from constant attacks, he had more time to reflect
            and think. Sometimes it was easy to wish he could go back to being
            Midoriya Izuku. It had been so simple when he just had to worry
            about making it through the school day and coming home to his
            mother.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although, he knew the decision wouldn&rsquo;t be easy if he was to
            be given a choice to change his past. Ruka, Hayami, Kayama,
            Tamakawa, and even Aizawa and Yamada were already irreplaceable.
            He&rsquo;d already spent years making his new appearance and quirk
            feel like they were <em>his</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Besides, he was already given the chance to change the past. This is
            his chance. However, the saying was still true.
            <em>You can&rsquo;t change the past</em>. Nothing would ever erase
            what he experienced. He could only move forward and try to move on.
            Besides, if he could, would he still be himself or someone new?
        </p>
        <p>
            Looking up to the night sky, he sighed. His name was Akatani Mikumo
            and that was by <em>choice</em>. Midoriya Izuku lived with a second
            chance he didn&rsquo;t even know he had. He was only eight years old,
            and his life was only beginning. Who knew where his story would
            lead? The only thing for certain was that he would never become
            Mikumo if the eighteen-year-old had any say.
        </p>
        <p>
            The serenity of the night didn&rsquo;t last long, for once. His
            musings were broken by a shrill shout broke through the darkness,
            &ldquo;Help!&rdquo; Mikumo never thought twice about it.
        </p>
        <p><em>His body moved on its own.</em></p>
        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />
        <p>
            Mineta Oshiyo grinned as he held his hand over the young
            lady&rsquo;s mouth to shut her up. She trembled under his touch,
            &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to make a scene now. I just want to
            appreciate your beauty up close.&rdquo; Deep purple eyes stared up
            at him with fear and anger.
        </p>
        <p>
            Luckily, it was late enough that no one would have been around to
            hear the cry she made. Oshiyo had this girl all to himself for the
            night! &ldquo;Are you going to be a good girl?&rdquo; She only
            hardened her gaze. A fighter then. &ldquo;Alright, we can do this
            the easy way or the ha&ndash;&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Oshiyo never got to finish that sentence before the ground fell out
            from underneath him. It all happened so fast. He felt something hit
            his back, and his last thought had only been confusion before all
            awareness faded away.
        </p>
        <p>
            Later, he would wake up in the hospital with a nasty concussion,
            cracked ribs, and cuffs around his wrists. He couldn&rsquo;t tell
            the detective who or what took him out. The only presence he knew of
            was the girl he had been trying to be <em>nice</em> to.
        </p>
        <p>The detective didn&rsquo;t buy that very last part.</p>
