            Despite how much Mikumo had wanted to keep sleeping on rooftops,
            especially Nekohana&rsquo;s since the building had quickly become
            one of his favorite places, he knew he couldn&rsquo;t keep doing so
            forever.
        </p>
        <p>
            It took some time, but he found a place on Saturday morning before
            his shift that was abandoned yet still in a prime location. Near
            Tatooin Station stood an old apartment building about eight stories
            tall. The roof even had door access.
        </p>
        <p>
            He took a unit on the top floor, cleaning it up over the weekend.
            With a little bit of work, he managed to separate its circuit from
            the rest of the building and connect some salvaged powerbanks and
            batteries from Takoba together. <em>Taser</em> made quick work of
            charging them up.
        </p>
        <p>
            Stretching as he got up for the morning, he made his way over to the
            fridge and pulled out some eggs before turning on the stove top.
            Today was the first day of May. Each day that ticked away really set
            home how Mikumo was never going back to his own time. Two weeks was
            an awful long time for a temporary quirk&rsquo;s effects, especially
            one so powerful as to bend time to its will.
        </p>
        <p>
            The smell of cooked eggs brought him out of his thoughts. Really, it
            was okay. So much had changed so quickly, and he was already
            settling. He already loved the life he was making here. While he did
            miss Kacchan and Kouta, he held onto the idea that they were doing
            just fine like a lifeline. They were not dead, there was no reason
            to grieve.
        </p>
        <p>
            Maybe he could make a garden on the roof and plant some flowers for
            them. Now that he thought about it, that space was perfect for
            growing his own food again. A rooftop garden sounded like a
            wonderful project to work on over the next week or so.
        </p>

        <p>
            Nemuri was exhausted. For once, she had a night patrol the night
            before and still woke up early for the weekly hangout with Hizashi
            and Shouta. How Shouta managed to somewhat function after and even
            <em>prefer</em> night patrols was beyond her. Music chimed softly
            throughout her apartment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Wincing as a nasty bruise made itself known, she stood up to answer
            her door. Given the time it was, Hizashi had arrived early, as
            usual. Sushi meowed at her as she walked past where he sat on the
            cat tree she had for him, even reaching out a paw for attention.
            Sighing, she paused for a moment to give him a small scratch behind
            the ears.
        </p>
        <p>
            The doorbell chimed again. Damn Hizashi for always being so loud
            even if she can&rsquo;t actually hear him. Finally opening the door
            as she yawned, the blond greeted her, &ldquo;Yo, Nem! Oh, you had
            that night patrol again, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; She nodded and
            rubbed at her eyes, &ldquo;You could have canceled our hangout if
            you were going to be this tired.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;Nonsense&rdquo; she yawned.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t even speak without yawning!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
            She glared, &ldquo;I just need coffee. Let me get ready and swing by
            the coffee shop, and I&rsquo;ll be good to go for hanging
            out.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Hizashi followed her inside as she padded back towards her room to
            change, &ldquo;Maybe I could get the coffee for you this time?
            Shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard, right?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Nah, I like the ritual of going to the cafe. I guess you
            could come with for once if we leave the door unlocked for
            Shouta.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>He smiled brightly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let him know then!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
            Nemuri closed the door as he walked back to the living room, tapping
            away on his phone. Normally she liked to wear something slightly
            revealing for the stares she would get, she loved the attention, but
            she wasn&rsquo;t feeling it today. Thus, she quickly pulled together
            some soft sweatpants and a hoodie.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thankfully, Hizashi was also in his comfy civilian clothes so he
            wouldn&rsquo;t stand out in a crowd either. He wore blue jeans with
            a simple red shirt, slightly covered with a black jacket that was
            softer than it looked. Kayama would know since she stole it on a few
            occasions. The thin necklace holding up a small cloud pendant was on
            full display around his neck.
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;Ready to go?&rdquo; he asked as she stepped into the room.</p>
        <p>
            She grabbed her purse from a hook on the wall, &ldquo;Yeah,
            let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            They made the short walk in silence, but that was just fine for
            Nemuri. Hizashi had his arm slung around her shoulders as they
            walked, helping to keep her in a straight line as she yawned over
            and over. The gray-blue front of the store luckily came into view
            soon enough.
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Oh right, I&rsquo;ll be able to meet the barista you
            couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about now, huh?&rdquo; the blond
            teased.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the hectic week she had, the strange white haired man had
            honestly slipped from her mind, &ldquo;Damn, I won&rsquo;t be able
            to keep up the persona from last time now. I forgot about
            that.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;What a shame.&rdquo; he said with no sympathy in his voice.
            &ldquo;The poor guy will be missing out on so much.&rdquo; Nemuri
            elbowed him roughly in the side, and he wheezed.
        </p>
        <p>
            The door chimed as she entered the cafe with Hizashi at her heels,
            &ldquo;Morning, Ha&ndash;&rdquo; A yawn cut her off again,
            &ldquo;Hayami, sorry about that.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            The black haired barista turned to her, while the white one
            nervously stared at her. Maybe she did leave quite the impression on
            him. &ldquo;Morning, Kayama. You&rsquo;re quite tired today, huh? No
            theatrics for my poor co-worker again?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Well, if they were asking for it, &ldquo;Well, I was quite
            <em>busy</em> last night. I wasn&rsquo;t given a break at all!
            Although, you know, I&rsquo;m always down to give a
            <em>private show</em>.&rdquo; Hizashi slightly choked behind her,
            despite being around her for years. Oh, it&rsquo;s on, &ldquo;My,
            ah, <em>friend</em> here would know all about that.&rdquo; She
            leaned against him more, looking at him with lidded eyes,
            &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            His face was already pink with blush. Flustering him was always too
            easy. The wimp. &ldquo;Nemuri, <em>please</em>.&rdquo; She expertly
            stifled her laugh and inwardly grinned. When would Hizashi learn to
            not make it so easy for her to follow up with something even better?
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Well&hellip; if you&rsquo;re <em>begging</em> for it.
            Let&rsquo;s get our drinks and food first, though, hm?&rdquo; She
            turned back to the counter to see the white haired guy looking quite
            dismayed at Hayami while they only grinned.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nemuri and Hizashi kept lightly elbowing each other as they waited
            for their order. &ldquo;Where did all this energy come from?! I
            thought you needed coffee first!&rdquo; the blond softly exclaimed.
        </p>
        <p>
            She still yawned before answering him as if to prove a point,
            &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t turn down such a
            <em>riveting</em> opportunity.&rdquo; He only sighed in response.
        </p>
        <p>
            Eventually, the white haired man tentatively called out,
            &ldquo;Kayama?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            She dropped the persona as she went up to the counter to hopefully
            throw the guy off even more, &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; She tried to stifle
            her yawn this time to no avail, &ldquo;Sorry, what&rsquo;s your name
            again?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;O-oh. Akatani, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;None of that ma&rsquo;am business. I&rsquo;m not that
            old!&rdquo;
        </p>

        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            &ldquo;Hey, Akatani.&rdquo; Mikumo hummed in response to show he was
            listening to them. &ldquo;Want to hang out tomorrow?&rdquo; He
            turned to face Hayami and blinked.
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Hang out?&rdquo; They actually wanted to hang out with him?
            That was a thing friends did, wasn&rsquo;t it? No one even wanted to
            be around him for years unless it was making fun of the quirkless
            freak. That wasn&rsquo;t what they were doing, right? No, no, Hayami
            <em>wouldn&rsquo;t</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            They smiled, &ldquo;Yeah, we could go to the arcade or something. Do
            you have anything you like to do?&rdquo; He liked following hero
            fights and analyzing them in his notebook. Stalking them, as Kacchan
            used to say.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mikumo didn&rsquo;t want to test their tolerance right now. &ldquo;I
            don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve been to an arcade before.&rdquo; he
            offered.
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;<em>What?</em>&rdquo; they exclaimed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,
            I&rsquo;m correcting that as soon as possible.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            It was their day off, and Mikumo found himself being dragged by
            Hayami as they raced through the streets. Omen ran beside them while
            almost tripping the other people on the sidewalk. &ldquo;I
            can&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;ve never been to an arcade! You have
            got to try DDR, it&rsquo;s a classic. Like retro classic, from the
            <em>Pre-Quirk era</em> classic.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            That caught his attention, &ldquo;Pre-Quirk?&rdquo; Most of the
            information and media from the Pre-Quirk era was missing. Many
            datacenters had been destroyed in the chaos rampant in the early
            2020s. Only traditional media and information personally archived by
            individuals made it through to the modern era.
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Yeah! This arcade has been open for over a hundred years! I
            think the owner&rsquo;s great-grandfather was the one to preserve a
            copy of DDR. I&rsquo;m sure more exist, but this one is local and
            open to the public!&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Hayami slowed as they rounded a corner and music greeted
            Mikumo&rsquo;s ears. He didn't have time to read the name of the
            arcade before they pulled him through the doors. Someone yelled in
            the back of the arcade and chatter assaulted his hearing. Bright
            lights flashed from machines, and an assortment of snacks filled his
            nose.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before he could process what was happening, a pink bracelet was
            placed around his wrist by what looked like a worker for the arcade.
            He only stared at it and blinked. &ldquo;Hey man, are you
            good?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;I&rsquo;m&hellip; uh&hellip; I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo; A group
            of flashing lights caught his attention again. He shook his head to
            try to get rid of the fuzziness that came over his mind. Hayami
            wanted to play a certain game with him, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that
            game you were talking about?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            It took a minute, but they led him through the arcade to a back
            corner with a large screen in front of a raised platform. The
            platform was divided in half with nine sections each. Two people
            already stood on the platform, moving in sync with each other as
            arrows glided across the screen.
        </p>
        <p>
            A small crowd was already gathered around, watching the two dance,
            and cheering them on. Mikumo only focused on how their movements
            correlated to the screen. The surroundings that had been
            overwhelming to his senses fell away as he analyzed. The game was
            simple, but the timing and movement would be what made it a
            challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
            An arm shook him, bringing him out of his head again. &ldquo;Man,
            you&rsquo;re already into it, huh? Trying to find some type of cheat
            code?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;Cheat code?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;A way to make the game easier or get an advantage someone
            else may not have.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Huh. Wouldn&rsquo;t a speed quirk be a cheat code,
            then?&rdquo; Well, depending on the game, different types of quirks
            would perform better than others.
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Not quite. There&rsquo;s this type of honor thing within
            gaming. Besting someone else without a quirk is way more impressive
            than getting a high score with a quirk. It&rsquo;s even more brutal
            when the player using a quirk still loses to the one that&rsquo;s
            not.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            It&rsquo;s more impressive to beat someone while quirkless?
            &ldquo;So, everyone plays quirkless?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Yep! The community around here values actual skill rather
            than how good someone&rsquo;s quirk is. Kinda similar to the Classic
            Olympics.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Hayami pulled him into a small line that had formed for the machine,
            and they continued to chat about more useless topics while they
            waited. It didn&rsquo;t take long for it to become their turn. After
            paying for a few rounds, Hayami motioned Mikumo to step on one side
            of the platform.
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Alright, I chose an easier song to get you started and a few
            of my favorites. Ready?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            After watching others play for so long, he felt like he had the
            basics down, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do this!&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            As expected, he was miserable through the first portion of the first
            song but got better as he got the hang of the timings and the
            placement of the arrows on the floor. It was strange and new, as the
            agility and speed he had honed over the past few years was
            applicable in a completely new way.
        </p>
        <p>
            The challenge was thrilling as he worked hard to beat Hayami at his
            own game despite never even hearing about it before. They took the
            win for the first game, of course. The second song became more
            difficult as the complexity increased. Focused only on the screen as
            his feet moved to the pattern and rhythm.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even with his best effort, he still came in second. Hayami tapped
            him to get his attention, &ldquo;Do you want to take a go at the
            full platform mode? You&rsquo;ll have to manage both sides.&rdquo;
            They smirked, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you can do it.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            A challenge? &ldquo;Hell yes! I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo; How hard
            could it be?
        </p>
        <p>Apparently very hard.</p>
        <p>
            Hayami chuckled as Mikumo groaned at the fail screen. The arrows had
            seemed to move faster than he could blink, and someone from the
            crowd had cried out about how cruel his friend was to put a newbie
            on the spot. The bastard had apparently given him the hardest mode
            available on the game.
        </p>
        <p>
            By the time afternoon rolled around, Mikumo felt like he had played
            most of the games in the arcade, as well as a few more turns on DDR
            against Hayami. He was exhausted. &ldquo;Think we should head to a
            park and just relax for the rest of the day?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            They looked up from the game they were currently playing, some type
            of shooter. &ldquo;Yeah, that sounds good.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            That&rsquo;s how they both found themselves sipping on milk tea
            while meandering through the nearby park. Bringing up conversation
            about inconsequential things, and sometimes just enjoying
            companionable silence. A brook cut through part of the park, and
            they stood on the bridge, watching as ducks swam around and dived
            for food.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mikumo couldn&rsquo;t help but smile as he leaned against the steel
            railing. He had a friend. A genuine, real friend. Yeah, he would
            always miss what he had, but he can cherish what he has. If he
            hadn&rsquo;t challenged All for One, he would likely still be with
            his brother, but he would have never met Hayami.
        </p>
        <p>His life was only still beginning.</p>

        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            The sun rose as Mikumo made his way up the stairs to his roof. With
            some of the money he had received, he bought some wood and salvaged
            what he could remember from the beach. <em>Blink</em> had been
            brought to nearly its limit over the last several days as he
            teleported the materials up rather than make so many trips back and
            forth on foot.
        </p>
        <p>
            Several rows of small garden boxes greeted him as he opened the
            door. A small pipe made its way between all the troughs, providing
            water from the small water tower that had already been on the roof
            before. A warm breeze hit his face and he closed his eyes to simply
            relish the moment.
        </p>
        <p>
            While he planted a lot of seeds himself, he had grabbed a few
            flowers to plant and get his garden started now. He double-checked
            that they weren&rsquo;t wilting before leaning with his elbows on
            the railing, staring off in the direction of the sea. Nearby, the
            low roar of iron on steel gained volume as a train made its way to
            the station.
        </p>
        <p>
            There were still several things Mikumo wanted to do with the space
            up here. Hanging more fairy lights, getting a few small benches, and
            maybe making an art piece from more Takoba scrap just for up here.
            Oh! He could probably paint the water tower with a small mural.
        </p>
        <p>Yeah, that sounded nice.</p>

        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            &ldquo;Morning, Akatani!&rdquo; Mikumo started as Kayami greeted him
            instead of Hayami for once. Well, to be fair, Hayami was late and
            wasn&rsquo;t even in the building yet. Part of him wondered if that
            was on purpose to make him interact with the full force of Kayama or
            an accident.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hiding his vague unease, he called out, &ldquo;Morning,
            Kayama.&rdquo; As she made her way up to the counter, he asked,
            &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your usual order? I don&rsquo;t have it
            memorized like Hayami does.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;A black coffee for now. I have some time before I have to
            meet up with my friends.&rdquo; She brought out her card to pay for
            the single coffee before continuing, &ldquo;Figured I&rsquo;d
            actually visit the cats here for once rather than just picking up
            food for the three of us.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Inwardly sighing in relief that she wasn&rsquo;t acting flirty
            today, he continued the conversation, &ldquo;Was the blond guy one
            of your friends or actually your boyfriend?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            She sputtered, &ldquo;Just my friend! We&rsquo;ve known each other
            since high school, but he&rsquo;s gay. Still easy as hell to
            fluster, though!&rdquo; she laughed. Mikumo sent his sympathies for
            the man as he turned to begin making the black coffee. She hummed,
            &ldquo;Anyway, do you have a favorite drink?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Got a favorite coffee? I always found it fun to know what the
            baristas like to drink.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            He looked to the side as he rubbed the back of his neck,
            &ldquo;Well, I haven&rsquo;t tried that much coffee yet. Tamakawa
            handed me one once, but I don&rsquo;t know what was in it.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your thoughts on black, then?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t tried it&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
            She gasped, &ldquo;Make one for yourself then! Try it! I&rsquo;ll
            pay for it when I order the rest of the drinks later.
            Promise.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            That&rsquo;s how Mikumo found himself sipping on black coffee for
            the first time while listening to Kayama ramble about her strange
            friends as she pet the calico in her lap. Apparently the blond he
            had seen before was able to function with four hours of sleep
            without a drop of coffee. Meanwhile, there was a brunet that needed
            caffeine to function.
        </p>
        <p>
            Kayama insisted that she sat in the middle between their two
            extremes. That she drank it for the taste rather than the energy
            boost. Most of the time, anyway. Mikumo did have to admit that there
            was a slightly addictive flavor he couldn&rsquo;t quite place behind
            the bitterness.
        </p>
        <p>
            Somehow, she managed to get him to go on a tangent about Pre-Quirk
            <em>memes</em>. He couldn&rsquo;t even remember how the conversation
            got to this point. &ldquo;It's honestly a travesty that I have yet
            to hear about a real longcat. Like, over a century and not a single
            cat has had a length enhancer or some type of stretchy quirk?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            She huffed with a laugh, &ldquo;What are you even on about?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;Longcat! Longcat is long!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
            Although, as he thought about it, did Garaki ever make a longcat? It
            would have been possible&hellip; The image of a twisted snake like
            cat with the signature thoughtless gaze and exposed brain of most
            noumu was conjured in his mind. Mikumo mentally shivered. Maybe it
            was for the best he never saw a longcat.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thankfully, Kayama was lost enough to just force a conversation
            change, &ldquo;I think I need to start heading back to the guys
            soon. Mind finally taking my order?&rdquo; He nodded, of course,
            &ldquo;Another black coffee to go, a large strawberry hot chocolate,
            and, here's the long one, an iced macchiato with two shots of
            espresso and a pump of vanilla.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            He silently repeated it to himself and got to work on the order,
            &ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Yep! A chocolate cookie, slice of lemon bread, and a cake
            pop!&rdquo; She stood up to release the cat she had held captive for
            the past half hour as he finished making and gathering everything
            together. &ldquo;It was nice chatting with you. Maybe I&rsquo;ll
            have to come by early again sometime!&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            He found that he slightly looked forward to it, despite his earlier
            unease about her. She was actually really nice and pleasant to be
            around. &ldquo;Yeah, I think I&rsquo;d like that. Have a good day,
            Kayama.&rdquo; Mikumo could see why Hayami liked her.
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;You too, Akatani.&rdquo;</p>

        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            Really, he hadn&rsquo;t been seeking her out this time, but Mikumo
            had made his way over to what was truly his favorite corner store.
            Aoitake Ruka sat behind the counter and visibly perked up upon
            spotting him. He had only wanted some colored pencils. &ldquo;Hey!
            Mikumo, was it?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Surprised, he managed to choke out, &ldquo;Y-yeah.&rdquo; He was
            honestly getting so used to people calling him Akatani that he
            forgot he gave Aoitake his first name.
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;My mom gave me the pocky you got for me, thanks!&rdquo; she
            bowed slightly. &ldquo;So&hellip; anything interesting to
            share?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            As he thought about it, he had a lot he could share this time,
            &ldquo;Got a job at a cafe nearby, and I made a friend for
            once.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            She gasped, sounding slightly scandalized, &ldquo;Are we not
            friends?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Huh? Well, I don&rsquo;t really know you&hellip;&rdquo; She
            had been nothing but kind so far, &ldquo;but Sure?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Aoitake pumped her fist, &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; She then grabbed a
            notebook from under the counter, &ldquo;Want to see my latest
            work?&rdquo; Mikumo simply nodded and went over to her. He
            didn&rsquo;t have anything better to do anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
            The next hour or so was filled with showing off sketches of all
            sorts of subjects. Aoitake mainly focused on portraits, while
            Mikumo&rsquo;s were littered with landscapes, the sky, people, and
            sometimes creative creatures that looked like they came from
            nightmares. He wouldn&rsquo;t tell her that those things had been
            very much real for him. Countless noumu stained his blades with
            their blood.
        </p>
        <p>
            She had marveled at his quirk when he forgot to be discrete and
            summoned his sketch notebooks in front of her with a flicker of pink
            light. He only complied when she playfully demanded to see all of
            his sketches after learning he always had <em>four</em> notebooks
            just for drawing always on him.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most recent drawing he made of his mother came up as Aoitake
            neared the end of the fourth notebook. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen this
            lady a lot, this time she&rsquo;s with a kid. Who is she?... If you
            don&rsquo;t mind me asking!&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            His voice still slightly wavered thinking about her, &ldquo;My
            mom.&rdquo; Blue eyes met his, filled with concern. A silent
            question and offer for him to go on, &ldquo;She&hellip; she died a
            few years ago.&rdquo; A tear rolled down his face and he smiled
            softly in spite of it, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still not over it.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            An arm came around his shoulders, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we ever
            fully get over it, and that&rsquo;s okay. I lost my dad when I was
            ten, and it still hurts when I think about it too long.&rdquo; She
            paused to breathe, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay to cry and grieve. I
            don&rsquo;t think enough people acknowledge that in this age. Crying
            is not a weakness. It shows the strength of heart.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Even with her words, he stifled a sob and worked to collect himself
            before mumbling out, &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Anytime.&rdquo; She gave him another quick hug before
            changing her tone slightly, &ldquo;Now, want to hear some of the
            things I&rsquo;ve heard the past few weeks? Old people gossip can be
            quite entertaining.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
            The rest of his time with Aoitake was spent hearing about how two
            old ladies were fighting over who had the better lawn, how a man got
            stuck in a tree, the story of a retired hero and his most memorable
            battle, the time a couple regaled how they met while stuck in an
            elevator. Each story stemmed from something true. Something someone
            shared with her.
        </p>
        <p>
            Maybe one day he would share more to his own story. He wasn&rsquo;t
            ready yet. Besides, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your story?&rdquo; The only
            thing he really knew about her beyond wanting to write and draw and
            create music was that her mother owned the store and her father was
            dead.
        </p>
        <p>
            Aoitake looked at him surprised. Her voice was tentative when she
            questioned, &ldquo;You&hellip; you want to know mine? I&rsquo;m not
            that interesting&hellip;&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>Mikumo smiled brightly at her, &ldquo;I doubt that.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Um, I guess&hellip; I suppose my story starts with just
            trying to survive high school and make it out on my own. Maybe get
            out of this town where people my age don&rsquo;t know wha&ndash; who
            I am.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            The small slip up intrigued him, but he didn&rsquo;t question it. He
            could relate, and he didn&rsquo;t want to explain that can of worms.
            Much less think about it again right now. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure
            you&rsquo;ll make it.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>Softly, she uttered, &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p>
    </body>
