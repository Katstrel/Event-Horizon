        <p>
            Mikumo stretched as he turned onto a side street, the amount of
            people on sidewalks thinning out as he did so. Rather than take the
            train back to his area of Musutafu, he wanted to walk and stretch
            his legs. Sometimes it felt maddening being cooped up for most of
            the day.
        </p>
        <p>
            The night runs had been helping with that the past few days. He was
            tired, yes, but in a week or two his sleep schedule will be cut into
            two. A few hours before midnight and a few more in the early
            morning. It gave him around two or three hours to practice with his
            quirks each night in the safety of darkness.
        </p>
        <p>
            He knew it was a risk to use multiple quirks in the open, but he
            needed to get control over his newer quirks. If it ever came to it,
            he could run, change his name again. Maybe hide deep in the
            wilderness on the other side of Japan.
        </p>
        <p>
            Soon enough, he reached his destination. A small chime from the dell
            attached to the door signaled his arrival. Aoitake had mentioned
            that she usually helped out in the store every Wednesday, and he
            found that he enjoyed her company.
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;Hey! How are you?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Tired.&rdquo; A yawn decided to make an appearance then, as
            if to emphasize his statement. &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Aoitake sighed, &ldquo;Not great, but doing better than
            earlier.&rdquo; He could see the exhaustion in how she held herself
            now.
        </p>
        <p>Curious, he prompted, &ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Well&hellip; A jerk at my school thinks it&rsquo;s funny to
            write on my desk before I get in most mornings. Usually I get in
            early enough to clean it off before homeroom, but I was running a
            little late this morning and got detention.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Wait, why did <em>you </em>get detention? That&rsquo;s not
            fair.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;The teachers don&rsquo;t like me.&rdquo; She slightly
            grimaced before shrugging, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine though, I&rsquo;m
            used to it. Just upset that I got distracted and didn&rsquo;t get to
            the classroom early enough like I normally do.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Well, Mikumo was upset on her behalf, &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t
            have to do that.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Her tone became slightly defeated, &ldquo;Yeah, I know, but,
            y&rsquo;know, what can you do?&rdquo; Without giving him time to
            respond, Aoitake shifted gears, &ldquo;<em>Anyway</em>, what have
            you been up to?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Taking the hint for now, he responded, &ldquo;Ah, I&rsquo;ve been
            working a lot more on my quirk analysis, and I&rsquo;m almost done
            with a mural that I&rsquo;ve been painting.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Oooo! Can I see?&rdquo; She leaned over the counter in
            excitement.
        </p>
        <p>
            He rubbed the back of his neck, &ldquo;Well&hellip; My analysis is
            written in code and the mural is on a roof.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Yeah, I get that you don&rsquo;t have the mural with you. I
            meant pictures, silly! And with the analysis, I mean, nothing stops
            you from reading it, right?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            He forgot about that, &ldquo;I guess I could, and I don&rsquo;t have
            any pictures.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Then give me your number and send me some next time you work
            on it.&rdquo; She fished a phone out of her pocket and tilted it
            forward slightly, waiting for him.
        </p>
        <p>
            Oh, how the hell did he forget about getting a phone? Actually,
            Mikumo knew how. He hadn&rsquo;t used the old phone his mother gave
            him for much besides reading and writing on hero forums when he had
            it. Now that he thought about it, he might have lost it at some
            point within Jaku. Aoitake was still looking at him expectantly,
            &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a phone.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;What?! How?&rdquo; She paused, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you need a
            phone for nearly everything these days?&rdquo; Mikumo shrugged.
            He&rsquo;s been getting by just fine without one. &ldquo;Like even
            managing your money requires a phone&hellip;&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve paid with actual yen for everything so far. My
            boss hands me my paycheck by hand at the end of each week.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;What about knowing how to get somewhere?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
            He grinned, &ldquo;I know Musutafu pretty well.&rdquo; Like the back
            of his own hand.
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Well&hellip; if you ever do get a phone, make sure to let me
            know. Anyway,&rdquo; The blue haired girl brought a notebook out
            from somewhere behind the counter, &ldquo;let me see your art from
            this week! Oh, and tell me about what you wrote. You&rsquo;re not
            getting out of that since you already agreed!&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Mikumo happily summoned his recent notebooks from
            <em>Pocket</em> and opened them across the counter. It was nice to
            have someone he could share his hobbies with.
        </p>

        <p>
            Nemuri arrived at Nekohana a little early again, unlike last week.
            Really, Akatani was just a mysterious puzzle to solve at this point.
            Well, more than that. Something about him just drew her to want to
            be friends with him. He intrigued her, and she wanted to find out
            more about him.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most surprising is when she brought up heroes last time while he
            made her coffee and he offhandedly said his favorite was Eraserhead.
            <em>Shouta</em>. The three of them had only been in the field
            properly for about six years, and even then, Shouta was deep
            underground. He hated the media and always took night patrols to
            avoid detection.
        </p>
        <p>
            How the hell did Akatani even hear about Eraserhead? It just added
            to the evidence that maybe this guy is or was involved with
            something underground. Shouta was already trying to bet on the
            barista having been involved with a fighting ring.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hayami looked up from the register and greeted her while she scanned
            for Akatani. Strangely, he was sat at the bar, furiously writing in
            a black notebook. She turned back to Hayami, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up
            with him?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            They only sighed, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been like this on and off for
            most of the week. Thankfully it&rsquo;s only been a few minutes at a
            time, and <em>usually</em> the door chime reminds him to at least
            check for customers.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Do you know what he&rsquo;s writing so intently about?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;Probably about quirks.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
            Well, now she was extra intrigued. &ldquo;Think we can take a
            peak?&rdquo; They stared at her for a beat before quietly walking
            over to stand in front of Akatani. Nemuri followed their lead and
            peaked over the white haired man&rsquo;s shoulder from behind his
            side.
        </p>
        <p>
            She watched as he wrote in all sorts of symbols she had never seen
            before. He muttered quickly to himself in a broken mess that she
            couldn&rsquo;t understand. Even then, she watched as he paused,
            erased a section and rewrote it without stopping. Whatever this was,
            it was second nature to him.
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;What the fuck, Akatani.&rdquo; Hayami beat her to saying
            anything. The man in question startled, and the notebook disappeared
            in a flicker of pink. &ldquo;Was that your analysis?&rdquo;
            <em>Holy shit.</em> This was not helping the underground accusations
            from her friends.
        </p>
        <p>
            Akatani seemed to briefly stiffen before relaxing, &ldquo;Uh,
            yeah.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Nemuri took that moment to sit herself on the stool next to him and
            probe for more information, &ldquo;Quirk analysis, you say&hellip;
            Are you any good?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;I- um, I just do it as a hobby&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
            Hayami cut in, &ldquo;Then what was up with all the symbols?&rdquo;
            Akatani slightly curled into himself, white and black feathers
            twitching against his back. &ldquo;Sorry, I&rsquo;m not judging.
            Just curious.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            He perked right back up. &ldquo;O-oh. I got into ciphers when I was
            younger. I made my own cipher that I guess has just continued to
            evolve through the years?&rdquo; A hand came up to rub at the back
            of his neck. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s now several layers of translation,
            but reading and writing it is just second nature at this
            point.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;What were you writing about?&rdquo; Nemuri asked.</p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;A speed quirk. Although, I think it might be a little bit
            more than just speed. Likely a kinetic enhancer that can either
            increase the speed or the strength of the user, depending on use.
            Either way, it would boost the amount of force the user can exert.
            So, a speed
            <em>or </em>strength quirk.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            It wasn&rsquo;t the worst she had heard, a bit more thought out than
            she would have expected from a casual hobbyist. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
            not half bad analysis if I&rsquo;m honest. I&rsquo;ve met a few
            professional analysts that would probably leave something like that
            as only listed as a speed enhancer and move on.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>He looked at her with a hint of disbelief, &ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Yeah! You wouldn&rsquo;t believe how common it is for heroes
            to go into missions with misinformation. Often times, false
            information is worse than none. It gives younger heroes false
            confidence.&rdquo; She watched in the corner of her eye as Hayami
            slunk away to make her usual order while she talked with Akatani.
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;What?! But heroes need to have correct information. It could
            cost them their lives! Can they really be okay with themselves not
            checking over their work?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            She shrugged, &ldquo;Like any line of work you&rsquo;ll have people
            who aren&rsquo;t in it for the passion but instead as a way to make
            ends meet.&rdquo; She looked him in the eyes, &ldquo;After all, were
            you passionate about coffee before applying here?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            He looked away and ducked his head down, &ldquo;I guess not but
            still.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like all of them are bad, and many don&rsquo;t
            do it on purpose.&rdquo; While knowing analysis and cipher was
            <em>interesting</em>, his passion for heroics was strange. It
            didn&rsquo;t quite line up with their theories, &ldquo;Say, if you
            felt so strongly about all that, why didn&rsquo;t you become an
            analyst in a hero agency?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Ah&hellip; I needed a job and didn&rsquo;t think about that.
            Besides, it&rsquo;s not that good&hellip;&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Nope. She wasn&rsquo;t having that, &ldquo;Hey, stop that. I already
            said you were thinking more about some random quirk than some actual
            analysts do for villains. That already makes you better than some
            professionals in my eyes, even if you&rsquo;re self-taught.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            He looked back at her in slight disbelief once more, searching for
            something in her expression. Jeez, this guy needed some more
            confidence. After several moments, he looked back down at the table
            and fidgeted with his hands.
        </p>
        <p>
            She let him stew on her words and his thoughts until Hayami called
            her up to pay for her food. Akatani still looked distracted as she
            gathered the drinks and snacks into her arms, so she simply turned
            to leave without saying anything else.
        </p>

        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            &ldquo;Thinking of leaving me already?&rdquo; Hayami joked, knocked
            him out of his thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;N-no!&rdquo; Mikumo sighed, &ldquo;While I would love to work
            in analysis, especially at a hero agency. I&hellip; I don&rsquo;t
            think I should.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            They cocked their head to the side, &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Omen
            jumped onto the bar to stare at him as if to emphasize the question.
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;Too much attention.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;What? I would bet you would be locked up in an office where
            the media couldn&rsquo;t reach you. Not like they're interested in
            the brains behind heroes anyway.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not it.&rdquo; Omen narrowed its eyes. Getting
            judged by a cat was not a good feeling, even if said cat was a quirk
            entity. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need any heroes looking into me.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>They hummed, &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
            He was silent for a moment, &ldquo;A lot of reasons.&rdquo; His real
            quirk was the largest issue. He was already messing up by showing
            <em>Pocket</em> around other people. Now, if he ever made a mistake
            and displayed a <em>second</em> quirk, people would question it.
            While he still loved heroes, he did not trust the commission, the
            police, <em>the system</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            No matter what angle he took, he couldn&rsquo;t figure out how the
            Hero Public Safety Commission had been so incompetent as to either
            not realize All for One&rsquo;s existence beforehand or severely
            underestimate the threat of his existence to public safety. Even
            then, the fact they threw him into Tartarus instead of killing him
            was definitely <em>a choice</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            His own thoughts on what the commission should have done were also
            quite hypocritical. He could recognize that theoretically he was on
            the same threat level as All for One. Someone else may say that his
            potential for destruction was too great to allow him to live as
            well.
        </p>
        <p>
            God, he was still trying to accept what he was capable of, but he
            scared himself sometimes. Based on what he had seen and done after
            The Fall, he could likely go toe to toe with Pro Heroes, as long as
            they weren&rsquo;t at the top of the rankings. Even then, All for
            One had taken out several of the top ten with little effort
            <em>at once</em>. Only All Might stopped him. That was not without
            losses.
        </p>
        <p>
            Omen stepped forward and started purring while rubbing against his
            arm. Hayami&rsquo;s voice soon followed, &ldquo;Well, wanna share
            any? I&rsquo;m here to listen.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Everything he felt and thought about the matter could be boiled down
            to one statement. Mikumo found that he trusted Hayami enough as he
            uttered, &ldquo;<em>I'm scared.</em>&rdquo;
        </p>

            &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Hizashi gawked, &ldquo;You were barely there
            for longer than last week! I swear, if it&rsquo;s on the same level
            as this Akatani guy having heard of <em>Eraserhead</em> I&rsquo;ll
            lose it. How are you getting intel this easily?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            She smirked, &ldquo;Trade secret.&rdquo; She honestly didn&rsquo;t
            know.
        </p>
        <p>
            Shouta stole his iced macchiato as she walked by him to sit on the
            couch. &ldquo;So, what did you learn this time?&rdquo; he asked.
        </p>
        <p>
            She hummed before answering, &ldquo;Apparently quirk analysis is his
            main hobby.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Oh great. A rogue analyst?&rdquo; The black haired man
            sighed, &ldquo;Please say he isn&rsquo;t that good.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Well&hellip;&rdquo; He groaned as she trailed off for
            dramatic effect, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t know how good he is for
            certain. His entire notebook was written in code!&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>Hizashi coughed on his hot chocolate, &ldquo;What?!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Please. No. I don&rsquo;t care about the bet anymore. Please
            say this guy isn&rsquo;t involved in the underground, or
            <em>at least</em> say he&rsquo;s one of ours.&rdquo; Shouta looked
            even more dead inside than usual.
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it wouldn&rsquo;t be that bad,
            Shou&hellip;&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Hizashi. Ciphered analysis. <em>As a hobby</em>. It sounds
            like something the rat would do. Kill me already.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;Nedzu-sensei wasn&rsquo;t that bad!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
            The brunet looked like he was having some type of flashback and was
            about to respond before Nemuri cut him off, &ldquo;Well,
            you&rsquo;re in luck. He seemed quite miffed when I mentioned some
            of the terrible analysts we have in agencies.&rdquo; She also took
            that moment to tease him, &ldquo;Besides, he likes you!&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            He stayed silent as he glared at her before the blond spoke up,
            &ldquo;Y&rsquo;know, I&rsquo;ve been thinking&ndash;&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s dangerous.&rdquo; Shouta cut in.</p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;&ndash;What are we going to do if we do find out the guy
            really is involved with something?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Ah, yeah, Nemuri supposed they had really been treating this like a
            game, but there was always a chance Akatani could be working for
            villains if he was involved with the underground. &ldquo;I guess
            it&rsquo;ll depend on getting more information. I think he&rsquo;d
            be inclined to work with heroes, but we could always be wrong. Hell,
            he could really just be an insane hobbyist that didn&rsquo;t grow up
            in a good area.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Hizashi groaned, &ldquo;How did we even get to the point of
            gossiping over if a civilian could be some sort of villain?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;Boredom.&rdquo; Shouta deadpanned.</p>

            Hayami Makoto couldn&rsquo;t get Akatani&rsquo;s slightly haunted
            expression out of their mind. After admitting he was scared, he
            refused to elaborate, no matter how long Makoto had waited for him
            to speak again. They wouldn&rsquo;t push him to speak if he
            didn&rsquo;t want to.
        </p>
        <p>That never solved anything.</p>
        <p>
            Omen materialized on their shoulders as they made their way back
            home. Makoto reached up to pet the sentient mass of shadows as they
            asked it, &ldquo;What do you think Akatani is scared of?&rdquo; The
            quirk yawned. &ldquo;He seemed excited at the prospect of doing
            analysis as a job, but something about hero agencies scared
            him.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            The scars didn&rsquo;t bode well in their mind. Could they be
            directly from a hero or because of one? Smaller villages were
            usually only protected by heroes who were born there, and it was
            also sickenly common to find heteromorph discrimination in rural
            areas. They themselves came from a remote village where even their
            black sclera and cat-like pupils got disdainful looks.
        </p>
        <p>
            The pitch black cat batted its paw against the side of their face to
            break their thoughts. Makoto sighed. Theorizing what happened to
            make Akatani afraid of heroes wouldn&rsquo;t do either of them any
            good, nor trying to guess what caused all the small scars, and a few
            big ones, across his skin.
        </p>
        <p>
            A thought crossed their mind, &ldquo;Do you think he&rsquo;d be
            interested in helping with some jobs?&rdquo; The cat
            <em>mrruped</em>. They hummed, &ldquo;Maybe we should mention it to
            Tama. Would be nice to get another ally&hellip;&rdquo;
        </p>

            Mikumo ran along the streets, weaving in and out of alleys. Musutafu
            was one of the most active cities for heroes in all of Japan. Mostly
            due to how many UA graduates liked to stay in town after obtaining
            their licenses. While this made the city among the safest to live
            in, this was purely from the low deployment times the city was able
            to boast. The actual crime rate was not much lower than the average.
        </p>
        <p>
            Well, that statistic was still a bit skewed. With the large amount
            of heroes, it attracted villains only looking for the fame or thrill
            of fighting in the daylight surrounded by a roaring crowd. It also
            left a massive hole in the underground from a lack of lower
            criminals, scared off by heroes, that allowed more dangerous
            villains to fester.
        </p>
        <p>
            The cries of a crowd caught his ears. Mikumo vaulted himself up the
            side of a building with the aid of his wings and scrabble of claws
            against the walls. Down the street only a few blocks away was the
            pro hero Death Arms fighting against a wolf heteromorph. Quickly, he
            jumped back down into the alley below and made his way to join the
            crowd with his red notebook in hand.
        </p>
        <p>
            Rather than standing at the police line, he found a low concrete
            barrier and climbed on top of it to watch the fight over the crowd
            as he wrote. While he would prefer the rooftops, he had to admit
            that staying up there during the daylight might look suspicious. He
            winced as the crowd surged in volume following the wolf hybrid
            getting knocked over with a nasty punch.
        </p>
        <p>
            He was still slowly trying to figure out what quirks he had, and was
            starting to suspect that one might be sensory based or had a
            secondary enhancement for some ungodly reason. The crowds
            surrounding hero fights hadn&rsquo;t hurt him before when he was
            younger.
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Come on man! I don&rsquo;t have time to deal with this
            bullshit! Let me go!&rdquo; the hybrid yelled while getting back up.
            The man&rsquo;s face seemed to be fighting between a more humanoid
            appearance and a full wolf&rsquo;s head. A transformation quirk with
            permanent mutations. Were the mutations vestigial or part of his
            quirk?
        </p>
        <p>
            Death Arms shouted back, &ldquo;You should have thought about that
            before you broke the law!&rdquo; He pulled his arm back to make
            another swing at the villain. Mikumo recalled that the hero had a
            strength quirk that was only centered within his arms. Two large
            weights were positioned around his wrists to provide more force for
            his punches.
        </p>
        <p>
            The man jumped backwards to avoid the hit. &ldquo;Is it really my
            fault if I can&rsquo;t control it?!&rdquo; he growled. Head fully
            transforming into that of a wolf and staying like that. Possibly
            heavily influenced by emotional state then.
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Then get quirk counseling!&rdquo; Ah, that showed how much
            Death Arms knew about quirks. Some quirks were more tied to emotions
            than others. Nearly every quirk had the potential to go out of
            control based on the user&rsquo;s mental state, but the degree and
            threshold varied based on, well, genetics and training. A quirk
            counselor might only be able to recommend therapy to regulate
            emotions.
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t afford it! I&rsquo;ll lose my job if you
            don&rsquo;t let me go right now&hellip;&rdquo; the hybrid trailed
            off.
        </p>
        <p>
            The hero readied another attack, &ldquo;The law is the law.
            Surrender.&rdquo; Seeing that Death Arms wouldn&rsquo;t let him go,
            the heteromorph raised his clawed hands and dropped to his knees.
            With the fight over, the crowd of spectators was quick to dissipate.
        </p>
        <p>
            As he finished writing up an updated entry for Death Arms and his
            speculations on the wolf man&rsquo;s quirk, Mikumo found that this
            fight left a bad taste in his mouth.
        </p>
        <p>
            By law, the man was classified as a villain for using his quirk in
            public without a license. He had indeed broken the law using a
            quirk. However, most enforced it with only a slap on the wrist if no
            one had been hurt. And no one had looked injured nearby&hellip;
        </p>

            He could see <em>perfectly</em>. Tonight was the new moon. Within
            the bright lights of the city, he hadn&rsquo;t noticed the
            difference. Was this a mutation? A simple passive night vision
            quirk? A secondary ability to another quirk or its own thing? Mikumo
            made his way through the winding trails of Keimei Creek. Each branch
            and blade of grass was visible to him in the near total darkness.
        </p>
        <p>
            For now, he shelved those thoughts. Tonight, he just wanted to relax
            under the stars and sketch them. Aoitake had taken an interest in
            them earlier after he told her about how almost every constellation
            had a story behind it. Corona Borealis shined brightly overhead in
            the absence of light. The crown of Ariadne.
