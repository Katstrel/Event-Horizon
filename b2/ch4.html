            <em>Saturday, April 21, 2136</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            Mikumo ran through the streets at a breakneck pace. The sun was
            rising higher on the horizon behind him. He had used Takoba to get
            ready for the day and eat again but lost track of time without, you
            know,
            <em>a way to track it</em>. The wind passed through his feathers as
            his wings corrected his balance while he rounded a corner at full
            speed.
            <em>7:52</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            Before he ate, the young man had found a white shirt and blue jeans
            that were both a little big on him, but perfect for what he needed.
            Using some scissors he found amongst the trash, he cut out a
            triangle in the back of it this time.
        </p>

        <p>
            Claws slipped on stone as Mikumo dodged from running into an old
            lady from the side. &ldquo;Sorry!&rdquo; Another storefront
            graciously displayed the time. <em>7:56</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            He made it another block before he was forced to realize that he
            wouldn&rsquo;t make it to Nekohana on time with the rate he was
            going.
            <em>Shit</em>. Decision made, he ducked into the first alley he saw
            and pictured the roof of the cafe in his mind. The force of
            <em>All for One</em> urged the quirk he named <em>Blink</em> to
            surge in strength from a dull hum that was barely there into
            something real, something powerful. With destination primed, he
            closed his eyes and <em>blinked</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The rooftop greeted him when he opened his eyes again, shadows along
            the edges of his vision rapidly retreating. Without stopping, Mikumo
            vaulted himself over the edge into the alley below.
            <em>Strength</em> activating to take some of the recoil as he hit
            the ground three stories down. The impact was less than he was
            expecting, even with the strength quirk.
        </p>

        <p>
            He didn&rsquo;t have time to ponder that as he raced his way out of
            the alley and around the street corner. Slowing when he approached
            the entrance to Nekohana, he glanced at a clock on the wall as he
            entered through the door. <em>7:59</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            Tamakawa leaned against the display case with his arms crossed.
            &ldquo;Cutting it close there, huh, Akatani?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            Mikumo ducked his head down. &ldquo;S-sorry, sir. It won&rsquo;t
            happen again.&rdquo; Already making mistakes. What was he thinking,
            trying to act like he was <em>normal?</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;Relax. I&rsquo;m just messing with you. Good job showing up
            on the dot, kid.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>&ldquo;Oh&hellip; Thank you, sir.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;Okay, none of that &lsquo;sir&rsquo; business here. Makes me
            feel old. Call me Tama or even Tamakawa if that&rsquo;s too informal
            for you.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>&ldquo;Right, sir! Uh, Tamakawa-san!&rdquo;</p>

        <p>
            The blue-gray haired man sighed, &ldquo;Close enough. Alright, kid.
            First order of business, follow me.&rdquo; Tamakawa walked around
            the display and between the pay counter and the side of the bar
            before going through the door in the back. Mikumo followed him up
            the stairs to a small lounge like area.
        </p>

        <p>
            About a dozen cats relaxed in various places all around the small
            space. &ldquo;This is the break room. You can keep your work clothes
            here if needed. I&rsquo;ll be lax about uniform until your second
            paycheck. After that, get a few white dress shirts and black
            slacks.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            His eyes flicked back to Mikumo, &ldquo;And keep them clean as best
            you can.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>&ldquo;Yes, Tamakawa-san. I'll try my best.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>
            The cat hybrid crossed the room and knocked on a door, &ldquo;This
            is private. The rest of this floor and the third one is my home, so
            only come past here with my permission or in an emergency,
            alright?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            He headed back for the stairs while a blue and white tabby tried to
            attack his tail on the way. On the wall next to the stairway was a
            line of coat hooks where a few blue-gray aprons hung, &ldquo;Grab
            one of these before you head back down. Take a few minutes to
            introduce yourself to the cats. Don&rsquo;t take too long, though.
        </p>

        <p>
            With that, the man disappeared downstairs, leaving Mikumo still
            slightly confused with what he was doing. Crouching down, only one
            of the cats approached him within a minute.
        </p>

        <p>
            A calico with well-defined patches that dissolved into chaos along
            her spine and tail. Dull yellow eyes stared at him before slowly
            blinking. He blinked back. She trotted away to the stairs afterward.
            Taking that as his cue to head down as well, he stood up quickly.
        </p>

        <p>
            Some of the cats looked over at him in interest when his small wings
            flew out to the side in an attempt to stabilize himself. A single
            feather floated down to the floor and a white cat immediately ran to
            play with it. Mikumo tossed an apron over his head and began to head
            down while a black cat tackled the white one. One of the other cats,
            a siamese, followed him along the stairs, almost tripping him.
        </p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;Alright! I&rsquo;ll give you the quick run down,
            you&rsquo;ll&ndash;&rdquo; Tamakawa was cut off as the cat leaped
            onto Mikumo&rsquo;s shoulders, making him stumble. In response, he
            had shifted his wings to balance and winced as he roughly hit his
            right wing on the counter next to him. &ldquo;The fuck?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>&ldquo;Sorry!&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;No, don't apologize. That was rude of me.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; He had not registered anything the man said as
            rude so far. What did he mean?
        </p>

        <p>
            Tamakawa looked to the side, &ldquo;I thought you were some type of
            mammal or reptile hybrid with the teeth and claws, not an avian.
            Whatever, doesn&rsquo;t matter, just surprised me, alright?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>&ldquo;Okay?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;Anyway, you&rsquo;ll sometimes help me bake when needed, like
            on busy days. Otherwise, you&rsquo;re just making coffee orders.
            Shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard to figure out. Almost everything is
            labeled, and Hayami can help you out if needed once he gets here.
            Oh, and keep an eye on the customers that order for here. Had one
            guy try to take Cappuccino once.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            Mikumo tried to look around the cafe on instinct before stopping to
            ask, &ldquo;Which one is that?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;The big fluffy orange one. He&rsquo;s a maine coon.&rdquo;
            Tamakawa pointed to a large beanbag next to the sofa near the front.
            The bean bag was covered in orange faux fur, easily hiding where the
            giant cat laid across it. &ldquo;Anyway, Saturdays are slower, but
            someone should come in soon.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            Right on cue, the door opened as a middle-aged woman entered. She
            blearily yawned as she strolled up to the counter. With the siamese
            still standing across his shoulders, Mikumo hesitantly smiled.
        </p>

        <p>He could do this.</p>

        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            A few hours later, Mikumo finally spotted the pitch black cat he saw
            yesterday. From a distance, it looked like a perfect little void of
            light. Hardly anyone else had come in to order something and stay.
            It was only the first woman and a man that were tapping away on
            laptops at their separate tables. Tamakawa had gone up to take a nap
            until it was busier.
        </p>

        <p>
            Out of boredom, be begun a staring contest with the void cat, only
            losing when Hayami finally showed up a minute later. He gave a small
            wave and smile to them before looking back at the cat&hellip; that
            was gone. Where the hell did it go so fast? Feeling something
            against his leg, he looked down to find who he&rsquo;s nicknaming
            Void until he gets their name.
        </p>

        <p>
            Another staring contest was initiated by the time Hayami returned
            from the break room to start their shift. &ldquo;Do you ever blink,
            man?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            Without blinking, he responded, &ldquo;All the time.&rdquo;
            Although, after a second, he looked over at Hayami and blinked in
            confusion, &ldquo;How did you know I was doing a staring
            contest?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>They only smirked, &ldquo;You lost.&rdquo;</p>

        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            That&rsquo;s how the first few days passed peacefully. He
            wasn&rsquo;t required to work on Sunday, but he surprised Tamakawa
            by showing up a few minutes before eight anyway. What else was he
            going to do?
        </p>

        <p>Nekohana wasn&rsquo;t open on Sundays.</p>

        <p>
            Tamakawa still only sighed and let him accompany him to help out
            with errands for running the cafe. The man led him to a street
            market where the smell of fish, people, produce, and herbal spices
            wafted through the air. It was all slightly overwhelming as he tried
            to follow Tamakawa through the space while trying to look at
            everything. He had promised to help, he couldn&rsquo;t get
            distracted!
        </p>

        <p>
            Together they gathered flour, fruit, and fish. As well as other
            spices, meats, and various ingredients. Some of the meat was solely
            for the cats. Apparently a balanced blend of meat was the healthiest
            food for them, and Tamakawa cared for his cats a lot. From what
            Mikumo had seen so far, it paid off.
        </p>

        <p>
            A few hours later they found themselves putting away the stock
            before cleaning up the first floor for tomorrow. Tamakawa mentioned
            paying him for his work that day, and Mikumo couldn&rsquo;t help but
            be confused. He offered to help because he wanted to, not for more
            money! The man only stared at him until Mikumo hesitantly accepted
            and left for the day.
        </p>

        <p>
            Monday morning had been slightly chaotic as tired workers lined up
            wanting coffee to get through the first day of the week. A few of
            them congratulated him for being a new barista, likely regulars, and
            tried to engage in small talk before laughing it off. According to
            them, Hayami wasn&rsquo;t into small talk either.
        </p>

        <p>
            Most left to get to their train or office in a hurry, but some of
            them stayed, bringing out laptops to complete their work or studies
            within the cafe. Mikumo couldn&rsquo;t blame them for wanting to
            relax with cats within their short breaks. Luckily, none of them had
            obnoxious meetings or if they did, they were quiet about it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Tuesday was much of the same, with a few less people trying to talk
            to him. Well, except for a child with no filter. He couldn&rsquo;t
            help but smile as she asked question after question about his
            strange mutations. Her mother was clearly embarrassed, but he
            enjoyed having someone as interested in quirks as he was for a
            change.
        </p>

        <p>
            He had continued to sleep on top of Nekohana during the nights,
            sketching cats and faces passing by in his free time, and jogging to
            Takoba to get ready for the day with the taste of salt on his
            tongue. For the first time in years, Mikumo strolled the streets of
            Musutafu with a small slime.
        </p>

        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            Wednesday afternoon, Hayami and Mikumo worked to clean the cafe for
            closing time. Void caught his eye again, not to be confused with
            Roast, the brownish-black cat that liked to sleep in the cat trees
            and mess with Dragon.
        </p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been meaning to ask, what&rsquo;s the dark black
            cat&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            It was a pattern that the cat would appear shortly before Hayami
            showed up. It would seem to disappear at times, or like it had the
            ability to teleport. And it never blinked. He could ask about that
            later, though.
        </p>

        <p>&ldquo;Omen&hellip; most of the time.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Most of the time?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s also Onyx, Otic, Oven, and Ooze. Hardly
            anyone can tell them apart except for me.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s five?!&rdquo;</p>

        <p>
            Hayami gave a Cheshire grin, &ldquo;Way more than that.&rdquo; In
            the next second, it looked as if there was a pitch black cat with
            yellow eyes staring at him from every corner of the cafe, and gone
            the next.
        </p>

        <p>Silence hung in the air for only a second.</p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so cool! Are they only made of shadows? Can you
            control them? Are they sentient? Are they illusions or constructs? I
            could feel them when I pet them, but what if that was an advanced
            illusion quirk? Can you see what they see or know what they know? Is
            there a range or a lim&ndash;&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>&ldquo;Whoa! Akatani slow down! Breathe!&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Oh! Sorry!&rdquo; His hands itched for a notebook.</p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine. I actually don&rsquo;t know the answer to
            most of those questions, but my quirk is called Shadow Cats.
            It&rsquo;s a bit like a sentient hivemind? Omen is the
            dominant&hellip; personality? A few others are named when they are
            able to act more independently of Omen. They are technically still
            part of Omen, I thin- Where did that notebook come from?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            Engrossed in his thoughts, he didn&rsquo;t pay any mind to
            Hayami&rsquo;s question. Near the end of their explanation, Mikumo
            couldn&rsquo;t resist any more and summoned his latest analysis
            notebook. The only sound that mattered was lead trailing along paper
            and his own racing thoughts that spilled out incomprehensibly in his
            focus.

            A hand on his shoulder jolted Mikumo, making him drop his pencil,
            &ldquo;S-sorry!&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>&ldquo;Jeez, man, you&rsquo;re really into quirks, huh?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>
            He hunched in on himself, hugging his notebook to his chest while he
            looked to the side, &ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s creepy, sorry.&rdquo;
            No one had ever liked his rambles&hellip; Well except for Kacchan a
            few weeks ago.
        </p>

        <p>God, that already felt like a lifetime ago.</p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say anything about it being creepy.&rdquo;
            Mikumo met their eyes in surprise. Was that actually genuine? Their
            pupils glowed with a bright white as they smiled widely once more,
            &ldquo;Besides, being creepy is kind of cool, isn&rsquo;t it? People
            tend to think I&rsquo;m creepy, too.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not creepy!&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not either.&rdquo;</p>

            The stars hung highly in the sky as emerald eyes stared into the
            abyss of the night. Eternal and unchanging. The complete opposite to
            Mikumo&rsquo;s own existence.
        </p>

        <p>
            It truly had been only a month ago when he lived on Takoba Beach
            with Kouta. It had been about three weeks since he saw Kacchan for
            the first time in four years. It had been only a week since he
            awoke, ten years from his home.
        </p>

        <p>
            What would it have been like to fully reconnect with his brother?
            What would it have been like to actually defeat All for One instead
            of being sent here? What would it have been like to help rebuild the
            world that had been lost in The Fall of Heroes?
        </p>

        <p>
            Mikumo would never know. His world had been tossed upside down the
            moment All for One had decided to stop playing around. When that man
            had tried to kill him and he <em>lived</em>. He couldn&rsquo;t wait
            to make All for One regret that in several years, even if this
            version of him didn&rsquo;t remember <em>anything</em>. That was
            part of the fun of it.
        </p>

        <p>
            He had lived to meet Hayami and Tamakawa. They were so kind to him.
            After today, he would even almost call Hayami a friend. Cats made of
            shadows soon joined the many images within the pages of his
            sketchbooks.
        </p>

        <p>
            Mikumo had to find silver linings where he could. Without being sent
            to the past, he would have never met Hayami and Tamakawa. Who knows
            who else he would meet?
        </p>

        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>Although, of course, luck was never fully on his side.</p>

        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            A short blond woman stared him down. Mikumo was just finishing
            writing down her order of an iced espresso with lemon bread to go
            when she crossed her arms and huffed. He looked up to find her
            looking past his shoulder before meeting his eyes,
            &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get any feathers in my food,
            <em>freak</em>.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            She hadn&rsquo;t been the nicest while ordering, but the sudden tone
            shift caught him off guard. He slightly stepped back from the
            hostility while his wings puffed up behind him. She grimaced and
            narrowed her eyes further at him.
        </p>

        <p>
            Hayami had come up to the side of the counter and leaned across it,
            also blocking the entrance to the back. With a kind smile and sweet
            tone, they asked her, &ldquo;What did you just call him?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;How can you stand working with this <em>animal</em>. I could
            never.&rdquo; Hayami only continued to hold the perfect, kind
            service persona through it all. The lady had the nerve to change her
            tone again to something nicer when addressing them, &ldquo;Actually,
            would you be so kind as to make my order instead?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            They took that moment to narrow their cat-like eyes into slits,
            putting their mutation on full display. &ldquo;I could, but are you
            sure I&rsquo;m not too much of an animal freak, as you kindly put
            it?&rdquo; She recoiled.
        </p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to speak to your manager.&rdquo; Oh lord, they
            were dealing with a <em>Karen</em>. Mikumo internally groaned even
            as Hayami called for Tamakawa up the stairs. He calmed slightly,
            finally able to read the situation better. The stairway creaked
            behind him as their boss came down to deal with this.
        </p>

        <p>
            Tamakawa poked his face around the corner and the woman immediately
            started, &ldquo;I want these two mutants fired. They have done
            nothing but menace me since I ordered. Honestly, their kind are too
            wild to do anything properly.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            The man sighed, clearly tired of this bullshit in Mikumo&rsquo;s
            opinion, before uttering darkly, &ldquo;Get out of my cafe.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            She did a double take before a broken, &ldquo;What?&rdquo; escaped
            from her mouth.
        </p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;I said,&rdquo; Tamakawa stepped around the doorway, swishing
            his tail behind him, &ldquo;Get out and don&rsquo;t come
            back.&rdquo; The woman paled before turning around and speed walking
            out of Nekohana. &ldquo;Man, I hate those types of people.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            Rain poured from the sky as gray clouds blanketed the city. It was
            already getting close to closing time. Mikumo sighed. He had hoped
            that it just wouldn&rsquo;t rain, ever. In retrospect, he should
            have searched for somewhere he could get out of the weather
            beforehand.
        </p>

        <p>
            It hadn&rsquo;t occurred to him to do so, since for the past few
            years he could camp out in whatever abandoned building he found
            first. There were plenty of those around, after all.
        </p>

        <p>
            Well, now there wasn&rsquo;t. Now camping out in a building was
            breaking and entering. What a <em>pain</em>.
