            <em>Breeze</em> felt more wild than any other quirk he had used so
            far. Which made sense. Beyond just being the untamable wind, it was
            the first quirk he had that affected areas far away from the body.
            He didn&rsquo;t need to touch anything to command the air around
            him.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the quirks he had currently identified, <em>Taser</em>,
            <em>Nyoom</em>, <em>Blink</em>, and <em>Pocket</em> were the only
            ones he had used extensively and fully understood. Each either only
            affected him or a small area around him. <em>Laser</em> and
            <em>Air Cannon</em> were still in the same category, generating some
            type of effect originating close to his body. <em>Freeze</em> was
            the only one that came close.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mikumo stood in the middle of a vortex as he tried to gain more
            control of the gale surrounding him. A small clearing provided to be
            an excellent training area as he tried to not hit the trees or
            himself. He was starting to have a growing respect for skilled long
            range emitter users. This had to be the hardest type for him to get
            down the
            <em>basics</em> of.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most well known hero with a quirk like this would be Best
            Jeanist. He controlled threads and strings with just a thought.
            Wait. No, more than that. Mikumo remembered how the hero&rsquo;s
            fingers seemed to always twitch during battle, and larger attacks
            had him swinging his arms.
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Was that a requirement?&rdquo; It can&rsquo;t be. Footage had
            also shown him controlling strings at a children&rsquo;s event
            without moving an inch. Why did he use hand movements then? Was it
            for added flair for the cameras? Or was there a use to it?
        </p>
        <p>
            Quickly dispelling the vortex, he commanded the wind to rush forward
            like a punch past his side without moving. The breeze was shaky,
            hardly able to be called refined, and had threatened to knock him
            over for a second. Only a small improvement from where he started.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, he tried again. This time tensing the muscles in his hand
            as he swung his arm in a similar arc to how he wanted the wind to
            behave. Mikumo&rsquo;s eyes widened as the gale barely buffeted him
            in its wake.
            <em>Progress</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Mikumo sighed as he observed one of the more minor personalities
            from
            <em>Shadow Cats</em> materialize inside the oven and sat like a loaf
            alongside the pastries Tamakawa had put in to bake. Hayami explained
            earlier on how Omen was the main consciousness of the sentient
            quirk, but there were a few notable and strange ones. Oven was one
            such entity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Apparently he had seen Onyx before, but Hayami wasn&rsquo;t telling
            him when. He could only guess that Omen and Onyx were nearly
            identical in how they behaved. Otic was loud as hell when it wanted
            to be. Sometimes even singing. Lastly, Ooze&hellip; The quirk entity
            wasn&rsquo;t able to maintain its cat like shape. It was quite
            horrifying the first time he saw the melting cat shaped blob.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tamakawa came up beside him and looked at the offending shadow
            construct happily absorbing the heat before sighing as well. The cat
            hybrid was way more accustomed to Hayami and their quirk&rsquo;s
            antics than he was. &ldquo;Anyway, getting back to what I wanted to
            bring up. I wanted to know if you knew anything about Tokai
            Tomoki&rsquo;s services. Tomoki is a friend of mine.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>Tokai Tomoki? &ldquo;Ah, who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
            The man raised an eyebrow at him, &ldquo;The man that gave you my
            business card? He likely gave you a little more than just business
            cards, though. Right?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>Oh. Yeah. Oh, shit. Nothing ever came free. Fuck.</p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Hey, calm down. Tomoki just has a proposition. You
            <em>can</em> refuse.&rdquo; <em>What?</em> &ldquo;He just wants to
            know if you&rsquo;d be interested in helping his operations.&rdquo;
            Just because he <em>could</em> refuse doesn&rsquo;t mean that there
            wouldn&rsquo;t be backlash.
        </p>
        <p>
            Taking a deep breath, he considered it. Tokai had taken care of all
            the paperwork for him to have a new legal identity. While he would
            have been able to do it himself given enough time, it was nice to
            have that sorted within a few days instead of a few weeks or months.
            Much less the risk that would have come from trying to do it
            himself.
        </p>
        <p>
            The pink haired man had said he just liked helping kids and older
            teens that were in need. Was that what helping in his operations
            would entail? If that was the case then, yeah, he was slightly
            interested in helping. However, &ldquo;What if I said no?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Tamakawa met his eyes, &ldquo;Then that would be that. Nothing would
            happen.&rdquo; No matter how hard Mikumo looked for it, he
            couldn&rsquo;t find any dishonesty in his gaze before the cat hybrid
            turned back to mixing batter. &ldquo;You can have some time to think
            about it.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            A pleasant breeze passed them by as they walked through the park
            near Tatooin Station. Flowers lined the sidewalk that looked and
            smelled beautiful. Tall trees shaded them from the late afternoon
            sun. They slowed as they neared an ornate pond.
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Can I have my notebook back?&rdquo; Aoitake asked. She had
            given it to him to store inside <em>Pocket</em> while they walked.
            Mikumo wasn&rsquo;t expecting to go on a walk when he showed up to
            chat with her again for the week, but he didn&rsquo;t mind it at
            all. Silently, the notebook appeared in his hand as he extended his
            arm forward. &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;No problem.&rdquo; Maybe there was some good in his friends
            knowing about one of his quirks.
        </p>
        <p>
            She sat down on a nearby bench and pulled the pencil out from where
            it was clipped to the cover. &ldquo;So, anything interesting
            happen?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been mostly normal. I got a weird side job offer.
            A kid almost hurt one of the cats before I stopped them. Oh! I
            finished the mural.&rdquo; He grinned as she playfully glared at him
            for bringing the mural up without having any pictures to show.
        </p>
        <p>
            She slowly smiled with a mischievous glint in her eyes,
            &ldquo;Actually, since we&rsquo;re out of the store today, you could
            just show me it.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Well, yes, but actually no. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s kinda hard to
            reach&hellip;&rdquo; Try the roof of an abandoned building. The
            stairs were intact all the way up, but he wasn&rsquo;t sure how
            she&rsquo;d react to the fact he was living there. Although, he had
            made it quite homey, if he said so himself.
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;So? It can&rsquo;t be that hard. It&rsquo;s also gotta be
            nearby, right?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;... Yeah?&rdquo; Mikumo groaned, &ldquo;Okay, fine. No
            judging, though, and I want to hear about your week first.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Ah, not much to say, I guess? It's the same old, same old.
            This asshole almost stole my notebook, but I was too fast for
            him.&rdquo; Her smile while saying that was almost feral, &ldquo;I
            managed to give him the slip and lock him in one of the classrooms.
            Best part is that no one would be able to trace it back to me with
            concrete proof that I did that and it wasn't just a
            coincidence.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Oh kami, I thought you would be the one normal friend I have.
            And once again, why does your school let him get away with all
            that?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Because they don&rsquo;t particularly care what happens to me
            as long as it's not bad enough to get a lawsuit or something. Not
            many people even bother to stand up for me. Anyway,&rdquo; She stood
            up and handed him back the notebook with a smile, &ldquo;Now, show
            me that mural.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            He slightly pouted as he made the object disappear in a flicker
            before leading Aoitake back out of the park and past the station to
            where the old apartment building stood. &ldquo;Ah, maybe I should
            have warned you that it&rsquo;s on top of an abandoned
            building&hellip; Still up for it?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Hell yeah! What&rsquo;s life without a little bit of risk and
            adventure sometimes?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            As they entered the building, Mikumo got a great idea, &ldquo;Want
            to race to the top?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            She eyed him for only a moment, &ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; <em>Gottem</em>.
            He immediately raced for the stairwell with Aoitake close on his
            heels. Taking the stairs one at a time, he gave her only a moment to
            taste victory as she passed him, before speckled white and black
            feathers helped him climb onto the railings and scamper up the open
            space between each turn afterward. She shouted below him,
            &ldquo;Hey, that&rsquo;s so not fair!&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;You agreed to a race with someone who climbs buildings for
            fun! What did you expect?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;You never said you <em>climbed fucking buildings</em>.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Aoitake was slightly out of breath by the time she made it to where
            he was perched on the railing waiting for her. The actual stairs to
            the roof weren&rsquo;t connected to the main stairwell but were
            located on the other side of the top floor. It was designed for
            staff access only.
        </p>
        <p>
            He kicked the doors to the floor open, revealing the dim lights that
            illuminated the hallway all the way back to where his apartment was
            next to the access door. The blue haired girl gaped, &ldquo;Whoa,
            this is like your proper hangout spot, huh?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Rubbing the back of his neck, he tipped his head back while they
            walked, &ldquo;Well, something like that&hellip; I live here.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;What?!&rdquo; She paused and looked at him, making him turn
            around. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t realize you were homeless&hellip; Oh
            my god, you were actually broke the first time we met, weren&rsquo;t
            you?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Is it really homeless if I live in an apartment?&rdquo; he
            joked.
        </p>
        <p>
            She stared at him incredulously before sighing, &ldquo;I guess
            not.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            They finished making their way to the roof, where she was once again
            blown away by the little garden he had made that was in various
            stages of growth since he planted all the seeds. The small bench he
            had made proved useful as they sat together, and he directed her
            attention to the water tower.
        </p>
        <p>
            The mural wasn&rsquo;t anything specific but instead a giant mix of
            all his different experiences. Small details culminated into the
            whole. A cyan ringed black hole sat in the night sky above a
            beautiful lake. An aurora reflected in the still waters. Large
            mountains ringed the valley it was positioned in. Thin, faint lines
            connected stars of all different colors into different
            constellations.
        </p>
        <p>
            A few nightmarish looking creatures stood at the edges of the forest
            at the base of the mountains. Flowers of all kinds could be found
            dotted around the landscape. Several people sat around a campfire
            near the lake. It all went on and on, and Mikumo was sure it would
            take Aoitake hours to discover all the small details.
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Kami. I knew it took you weeks to finish this,
            but&hellip;&rdquo; she trailed off. Words likely failing her. He
            felt slightly embarrassed as she found them again, &ldquo;a picture
            would not have been able to capture it all.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            In the end, she had taken a long time studying each inch of the
            painting while he tended to his plants. They continued talking
            during that time, sometimes about what a section of the painting was
            about or how he had done it. He didn&rsquo;t regret showing it to
            her in person.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the late afternoon began to roll into evening, he invited her
            down into his apartment for dinner. She had once again marveled at
            all the soft lights he had strung up and how well off he was living
            despite not actually owning a home. It didn&rsquo;t save him from
            the mild teasing of how many blankets he had around the place,
            though.
        </p>

        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            A soft, metallic thud rang through the alley as he landed on a fire
            escape. Leaving not a moment to rest, he vaulted himself across the
            space to the next building. While there was no reason for him to
            patrol anymore he still couldn&rsquo;t stop the urge to move. To run
            across the city as if he were still on the lookout for noumu.
        </p>
        <p>
            The wind in his white hair and feathers was addicting as he jumped
            from building to building. A reminder that he was free. Despite the
            desolation left in the wake of The Fall of Heroes, Mikumo had always
            been at peace in the quietness of the cities and wilderness. People
            had not been kind beforehand.
        </p>
        <p>
            The few that were left still were not kind. Where he had once been
            outcasted for having no quirk at all, the people shunned him for
            having
            <em>too many</em>. New Musutafu had been complicated. The people
            living there feared him. Yet, they revered him for his ability to
            keep noumu and people only seeking destruction away. Called him a
            monster, a demon. Named him Tengu, a yokai that meant protection.
        </p>
        <p>
            Slowing as he landed on another roof, he took in the moment and the
            warm air blowing against his freckled face. The city of Musutafu
            stared back at him. He&rsquo;d protect this city from becoming the
            wasteland in his memories. Maybe in the meantime, he could help
            protect kids in need that didn&rsquo;t trust the system to help
            them.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>
            &ldquo;Why must you torture me like this?&rdquo; Shouta bemoaned as
            Nemuri showed him a picture of her holding Cappuccino, the large
            orange maine coon located in Nekohana, from earlier today. Akatani
            had helped her take the picture, since the behemoth required both
            her arms to hold.
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny.&rdquo; She turned the picture to Hizashi,
            &ldquo;Besides, you did it to yourself.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Man, I need to go back to the cafe just for the cats soon.
            They&rsquo;re all so soft!&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;Not you too, &lsquo;Zashi.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
            The blond only smiled at him, &ldquo;Maybe if you ask very nicely,
            the owner will forgive you.&rdquo; Shouta groaned.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nemuri cut between them before the teasing could get out of hand,
            &ldquo;Anyway, I actually invited Akatani to hang out at the mall on
            Sunday. Do either of you want to come with?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            The black haired man raised an eyebrow at her, &ldquo;Did you make
            sure it was alright to invite us beforehand?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yeah. I mentioned I might bring some friends.&rdquo;</p>

        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            Mikumo hopped off the train beside Kayama and her friends, Yamada
            and Aizawa. Yamada had been the man with Kayama once before, with
            long blond hair hanging loosely well past his shoulders and an
            easy-going attitude. Aizawa on the other hand was quite reserved and
            had hung up his black hair in a bun. Despite coming off as kind of
            shy, he had no shame in wearing neon pink sweatpants in public.
        </p>
        <p>
            Kayama looped her arm around his shoulders as they all walked out of
            the station near Kiyashi Ward Shopping Mall. &ldquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s
            been so long since I&rsquo;ve visited the mall!&rdquo; she
            exclaimed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll visit the tech store first, since you
            mentioned wanting to buy a phone the other day. Shouta, Hizashi,
            where do you guys want to go after that?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Yamada spoke first, &ldquo;It might be fun to hit up the record
            store. Nothing beats the classics and the sound of vinyl.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need anything.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;C'mon, Shou, not even a new cat keychain?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
            Aizawa was silent for a second before saying, &ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo;
            Mikumo couldn&rsquo;t help but quietly snicker at that. The man
            glanced menacingly at him, &ldquo;Oh? What are you laughing
            at?&rdquo; He quickly stopped.
        </p>
        <p>
            Kayama turned to look at Aizawa without moving her arm,
            &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t threaten the child.&rdquo; Mikumo was unsure
            whether he wanted to be offended at being called a child or not.
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;Are you sure this is a child?&rdquo; Thank you, Aizawa.</p>
        <p>She paused and turned to him, &ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Eighteen, I&rsquo;ll be nineteen in about a month.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;See? Child.&rdquo; Oh, fuck you, Kayama.</p>
        <p>
            Since she brought it up&hellip; He was curious, &ldquo;How old are
            you guys?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            She sniffed in response, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know to never ask a
            wom&ndash;&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;She&rsquo;s twenty-four. Shou and I are twenty-three.&rdquo;
            Kayama rounded on the blond faster than Mikumo could track, murder
            in her eyes. &ldquo;Wait, Nem, we can talk about this!&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Her tone became sickeningly sweet as she practically purred,
            &ldquo;<em>Sure, Hizashi-kun</em>.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            A little later, he compared different models of phones without fully
            understanding what all the details meant while Aizawa stood at his
            side. Even though the man was able to be quite threatening with only
            a single glance, at least he wasn&rsquo;t causing a scene like the
            other two behind them.
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;Mikumo was surprised when he spoke up in the comfortable
            silence between them, &ldquo;Do you need any help choosing?&rdquo;
            He looked up from the phone he was inspecting, meeting
            Aizawa&rsquo;s black eyes, &ldquo;You just seemed confused.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah&hellip; I&rsquo;ve never bought a phone before. I
            just want something to text and call on that won&rsquo;t need much
            charging.&rdquo; He shrugged before adding, &ldquo;Maybe browsing a
            few forums.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Aizawa just started silently walking away after motioning him to
            follow. He set down the device he had been holding and caught up
            with him as he explained, &ldquo;There are some cheap phones that
            sound perfect for what you want in the back. Most of the newer
            models just have fancier cameras or are more powerful for games, but
            are way more expensive.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            The selection was quite small, but that didn&rsquo;t bother him.
            &ldquo;Any recommendations?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve gotten the same model the past several
            times.&rdquo; The man grabbed a small black phone that didn&rsquo;t
            look anything special, &ldquo;There might be something better, but
            this one is good. It can survive a good beating before breaking, and
            the battery can last several days if you don&rsquo;t use it
            much.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Taking it from his outstretched hand, Mikumo looked it over. He had
            enough yen stored in <em>Pocket</em> to cover it, &ldquo;Thank
            you.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
            He didn&rsquo;t think far enough ahead to put the yen in his actual
            pocket before heading out, but he sighed in relief as the clerk
            didn&rsquo;t mind the brief quirk use to pay for his new phone.
            After that, he and Aizawa grabbed Kayama and Yamada to make their
            way to the record store. The two of them had calmed down while they
            were busy.
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Yo, Akatani, do you have any favorite songs?&rdquo; Yamada
            had come up beside him as they came up to the store.
        </p>
        <p>
            He hadn&rsquo;t had the means to listen to music in years and before
            then, he hadn&rsquo;t been into certain artists, &ldquo;Never really
            thought about it that much. Music just sounds nice.&rdquo; A memory
            hit him from his time in Jaku and he smirked, &ldquo;Actually, have
            you ever heard <em>Never Gonna Give You Up</em> by Rick
            Astley?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            The blond blinked and looked at him with curiosity, &ldquo;Never
            heard of it, actually. Are they an indie musician? What year was it
            released?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;I actually don&rsquo;t know&hellip;&rdquo; Mikumo admitted.
        </p>
        <p>
            He hummed, &ldquo;Well, guess I&rsquo;ll have to find it
            then!&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            The three of them waited by the entrance while Yamada browsed the
            recent collection after that. Aizawa looked to be lightly sleeping
            as he leaned against the wall and Kayama was typing away on her
            phone. He pulled his new phone out of his pocket, his real one, no
            way was he risking a public quirk usage charge in such a crowded
            area.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fiddling with the device, he managed to rediscover how to add
            contacts. Aoitake had given him a piece of paper with her number on
            it a while ago, and he took it out while he was getting his yen
            earlier.
        </p>
        <p>
            Only a second after he had finished, Kayama quickly swiped his phone
            out of his hand and gave it back before he could fully process that
            she had done that. He looked down to see she had put her own contact
            in. &ldquo;Oh, thanks.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Yeah, feel free to text me anytime. Might not be able to
            respond right away, though.&rdquo; She glanced at the resting
            brunet, &ldquo;Shouta, we&rsquo;re needed for a surprise meeting
            soon. We&rsquo;ll have to start heading back towards Musutafu once
            Hizashi is done.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Oh. Mikumo had been enjoying hanging out with them, but he supposed
            it couldn&rsquo;t last forever. Aizawa grumbled in response before
            holding his hand out towards him, &ldquo;Let me give you my contact
            too. So far, you&rsquo;ve been more tolerable than these two.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Yamada had arrived just in time to hear that and shouted,
            &ldquo;Hey! That&rsquo;s so uncalled for.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Hizashi, Shouta and I need to head out. You two are free to
            continue without us, or we can all head back together.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh. Akatani, what do you want to do?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
            He didn&rsquo;t want to be a burden, &ldquo;Uh&hellip; Whatever you
            want to do?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            The blond man stared at him critically for a second,
            &ldquo;Well&hellip; I&rsquo;m a little hungry, so how about we get
            some lunch and decide then?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, okay!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
            Kayama and Aizawa said their goodbyes as Mikumo followed Yamada to
            the food court. While he was a little unsure of himself without
            Kayama around, Yamada filled the silence and managed to keep the
            conversation going with ease while they ate. He was quite enjoyable
            to be around. By the time both of them were tired enough to head
            back home, Mikumo had another number in his contacts and a small
            smile on his face.
