            A green haired boy stood on the edge of a police line. The hero
            Backdraft worked on containing a man who could cover himself in
            flames. The Pro Hero had water spouts replacing where his hands
            would be, a mutation class quirk, with the ability to control the
            water he produced.
        </p>
        <p>
            How was the water acquired? Could he have control of any water that
            mixed with his own? Was it even fully water? Has anyone ever tested
            that it was fully pure water, or what minerals could be in it? And
            his hands, how did he grab anything or eat? Why was he born with
            spouts for hands, anyway?
        </p>
        <p>
            Steam rose into the air above the crowd in the street, the man on
            fire burned even brighter. You would think water beats fire in any
            scenario, but Backdraft was struggling to control the blaze.
        </p>
        <p>
            How was the man able to burn for so long and hot? What were his
            limits? Did he still have his clothes under the fire? How was that
            even possible? Could the fire be controlled of what it burned? What
            mutations might he have to allow him to survive being on fire?
        </p>
        <p>
            Izuku’s thoughts ground to a halt, everyone had mutations. Even he
            had green hair that would not have existed before quirks. It made so
            much sense that he felt stupid for not realizing it. He never
            actually put in the time to research the why and how behind quirks
            beyond the implications of what could be done with them.
        </p>
        <p>
            If everyone possessed left over mutations that were passed on from
            their ancestors, who was truly quirkless? Those without quirks, yes,
            but mutation class existed. Were there people without quirks that
            were born with anthropomorphic features from their parents and were
            just listed as having a quirk?
        </p>
        <p>
            What counted as a quirk? What fully determined a person’s quirk? How
            did quirks even come to be? How had he overlooked looking deeper
            into quirks themselves instead of individual ones?
        </p>
        <p>It was time to change that.</p>

            meta-abilities started appearing long before her. Myths and legends
            of supernatural beings are common in folk lore all over the world

            Alpha Elements may even be present as deep as DNA. After years of
            studying the DNA sequencing of both quirked and non-quirked
            individuals and the family trees of participants, it is confirmed
            that DNA does at least influence what type of quirk an individual
            may or may not receive.
        </p>
        <p>
            It may even be possible to force quirk activation within a

            meta abilities, also known as quirks. Due to this, I refer to the
            changes within meta-humans compared to regular people as Alpha
            Elements within this paper. The presence of Alpha Elements may even
            extend to the DNA level, which calls into question on whether
            meta-humans are even human, but I digress.

            of the meta-ability are Minus Alpha Elements. I will go further into

            During the Dawn of Quirks, anyone who was abnormal, with something
            as simple as green hair, was called a meta-human. The early term for
            people with quirks!
        </p>
        <p>
            Over time, more simple mutations became the norm and accepted as the
            baseline for humans. The line between the quirkless and quirked
            became blurry, with diagnosis becoming more subjective. With the
            passing of generations, everyone now had genes for quirks. It was
            only a matter of how those genes were expressed.
        </p>
        <p>
            It soothed something inside of him to know that no one was truly
            quirkless anymore. He wasn’t quirkless. He wasn’t abnormal. He just
            didn’t have any obvious abilities. A hundred years ago, his green
            hair would have been classified as a quirk. Though, no one around
            him would listen to that. He already knew.

            <i>What else would mark him as a meta-human?</i>

            <i>Quirk Singularity Theorem</i><br />by Garaki Kyuudai, 2073

            –hird thirty-year generation cycle since the Dawn of Quirks, we have
            already seen great-grandchildren of early quirk users manifest their
            quirks. I’ve had the pleasure of studying some of these individuals
            within my research, and a few are even the fourth generation within
            their lineage to possess quirks!
        </p>
        <p>
            As time has progressed, quirks have gotten more complex in how they
            function and their effects have gotten stronger. If this trend
            continues, quirks may become too powerful or complex to control.

            Since then, quirks have indeed gotten stronger and more complex in
            following generations. Although, there is also overwhelming evidence
            that humanity will evolve to handle these abilities rather than

            With that knowledge, I moved on to inserting DNA for certain quirks
            into organisms that had ample Alpha Energy, also known as Alpha
            Potency, then applying external pressure to force the activation.

            Toogata Mirio stared at the bony skeleton of a man Sir Nighteye had
            requested him to meet. The blond man should eat more, that physique
            could not be healthy at all. The man spoke up before Mirio could
            attempt to introduce himself first, “Ah, hello, my name is Yagi,
            Yagi Toshinori. Nice to meet you young Toogata.”
        </p>
        <p>“Nice to meet you too, Yagi.”</p>
        <p>
            “I’m actually here with an offer at Nighteye’s insistence. You see,
            I’m an old hero, but my health has been making it harder and harder
            to fight crime. I’ll have to retire soon, and I need a successor.
            Nighteye here as been vouching for you, and I’ve finally come to see
            you for myself. Based on reports, I may not be able to find someone
            else more worthy of this offer in the short time I have left.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Yagi sat leaning forward with his hands steepled and eyes nearly
            glowing blue from his intense gaze. Mirio didn’t fully understand
            the circumstances, but he could feel the weight of the offer. Sir
            believed that he could measure up to Yagi’s expectations and wanted
            him to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
            Though, he still wanted to know what he was getting into first,
            “What will this entail, Yagi?”
        </p>
        <p>
            Yagi lost some of his intensity and became quite bashful at that,
            “Ah, I would pass my quirk on to you. It is a strength enhancer
            called <i>One for All</i>, passing on from one holder to the next
            since the Dawn of Quirks. A constellation of power connected by the
            hopes and dreams of a long line of heroes. My mentor gave me this
            quirk almost forty years ago now.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Mirio blinked, <i>“Excuse me?!”</i> Forget whatever extra training
            he had been mentally preparing for. <i>A quirk?!</i> “Sorry Yagi,
            just, how is that even possible?” This man in font of him wanted to
            give him an ancient, probably sacred, secret quirk. This had to be a
            joke.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yagi only smiled, a sparkle in his eyes with a hint of mischief,
            “Quite simple! DNA transfer!”
        </p>
        <p>
            “This is a joke.” Mirio didn’t mean to say that out loud, but the
            sheer incredulous of the situation tore through whatever filter he
            maintained. Even if the man was a friend of Sir Nighteye, he
            expected him to at least be serious when offering a mentorship that
            would likely cut into his time with Sir.
        </p>
        <p>
            The old blond regained some of the intensity within his gaze and
            straightened his posture. “Young Toogata, this is not a joke. If you
            accept my offer, I’ll give you <i>One for All</i>. You are already
            an amazing hero. I trust you to do great things with this power.
            Now, will you accept?”

            Inko watched as the light slowly regrew within Izuku’s eyes. He
            spent even more time chasing heroes recently and filling out his new
            notebook at a rate she had never seen before. The last time he was
            this fanatic over quirks was before his diagnosis, theorizing over
            what quirk he would have.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even then, he didn’t have the knowledge or skill he has now to
            finely break apart each quirk he lays his eyes on. Izuku had come up
            to her over <i>Attraction</i> with questions she had never
            considered.
        </p>
        <p>
            She would do right by him this time. That evening they learned the
            true limits of what her simple, weak telekinesis could do. She could
            hold over a dozen objects at once, controlling them independently,
            even if that gave her a headache. The sparkle in his eyes, the
            amazement at her even if she wasn’t a hero, was more than worth it.
        </p>
        <p>
            They sat within the living room later on, watching a documentary of
            the Glowing Baby. She couldn’t help but be intrigued about the Dawn
            of Quirks alongside her son. Inko wondered where this reinvigorated
            deeper interest in quirks would take him.
        </p>
        <p>
            She would be there this time. She promised herself. Promised
            silently to Izuku. She would try her best to foster his passion this
            time. Even if he rediscovered his dream of becoming a hero. Even if
            she had to constantly fret over his safety. She would be on his side
            completely.

            <p>Dear Midoriya,</p>
            <p>
                I’ve been alerted to recent activity towards my publications.
                Imagine my surprise when, upon further inspection, it is from a
                bright young mind like yourself. It is not often that someone is
                as passionate about quirks as you or me. Much fewer, ones that
                show an interest in my area of studies!
            </p>
            <p>
                Due to your apparent interest in learning more deeply about
                quirks, I’d like to offer you a position as my personal
                assistant. I’m not getting any younger after all! This position
                would require you to be present within the research facility
                full-time with very few vacations, and your continued schooling
                would be sorted out by myself and my associates.
            </p>
            <p>
                Do think about this opportunity. I look forward to hearing from
                you.

            Izuku sat on the roof of Aldera Junior High. Even if Kacchan had
            stopped bothering him and by extension the rest of his followers, he
            didn’t trust eating within the cafeteria with everyone else. Other
            classes tended to either completely ignore his existence or make fun
            of him.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometimes stealing bits of his lunch, claiming that quirks required
            more energy, so he didn't need to eat as much as them. While that
            could be true for some quirks, it was usually paired to certain
            diets or, rarely, an overall boost to metabolism that required
            frequent snacks.
        </p>
        <p>
            He pulled out his lunch as he thought over the possibility of
            Kacchan requiring a higher sugar or fat intake. His childhood friend
            sweat a nitroglycerin like substance and glycerine could be made
            from fats, oils, or sugar.
        </p>
        <p>
            Halfway through his meal, his thoughts were disrupted from a
            notification sound. Maybe it was a new trending post on HeroNet?
            Even if he wasn’t as excited about the heroes themselves anymore,
            HeroNet was the best place to see reports and footage of quirks in
            action.
        </p>
        <p>
            Alas, there wasn’t a new top story to look over but an email. It
            didn’t look like a corporate email sent out of marketing or
            newsletters. It was an email personally addressed to him, of all
            people.

            <p>Dear Dr. Garaki,</p>
            <p>
                Really?! Though, I’m sure you could find better candidates than
                me for such a position. I’m not that special. Also, the fact
                you’re emailing me must mean I was correct in my theory that you
                might have been the child with the slower aging quirk from
                Cheswick’s 2024 article about the beginnings of meta-humans!
                Some of your public records didn’t match up with your experience
                or the pictures I could find of you. Ah, sorry, that may be
                creepy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Getting back on track, before I could even think of accepting,
                my mom would have to agree to allow me to study under you and
                that may be a bit unlikely… Could you allow some time for me to
                think on this, convince my mom, and for you to be sure you want
                me for such a position?
            </p>

        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            Izuku stared at his screen. <i>The</i> Dr. Garaki reached out to
            him. One of the leading scientists in the study of why and how
            quirks appear. Some of his work was controversial or out right
            banned nowadays, but from what Izuku could find in his research so
            far, the work was solid and was referenced a lot if one looked deep
            enough within reports.
        </p>
        <p>
            He still didn’t have a dream in mind to work towards, but this?
            Maybe he could be a quirk scientist. Helping to discover the full
            possibilities of ways quirks manifest and what causes them to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although, some of Garaki’s methods outlined in his studies did rub
            Izuku the wrong way. Was it really necessary to have stressed people
            into a life or death situation, even if they were safe in a
            controlled environment? Was discovering that forced quirk
            manifestations were real worth it?
        </p>
        <p>
            Izuku wasn’t sure. He thinks… maybe it was… Forced manifestations
            are just another piece to the puzzle that quirks are. Was it
            possible for someone with a manifested quirk to trigger the same
            mechanism for forced manifestations? What would that do?
        </p>
        <p>Was it bad that Izuku wanted to find out?</p>
        <p>
            Alas, was he willing to leave his mother to study under Dr. Garaki?
            She was the only one to support him in any way. She may not have
            been perfect, may not have supported his dream of being a hero when
            he was found to be quirkless…
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>“I’m so sorry, Izuku!”</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            She may not have been the best at being there when he needed her,
            but she was his Mom. And she tried so hard to support him, to take
            care of him, even if it wasn’t perfect.
        </p>

        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>It had started with a simple cough.</p>
        <p>
            That’s all it had been. A cough. It started on a day out, just him
            and his mother, Inko, taking a walk around Musutafu Central Park.
            They had just gotten ice cream from a small stand near the outer
            edges of the park. It was painted blue.
        </p>
        <p>
            Chocolate ice cream for his mother, and mint chocolate chip for him.
            Sat together on a bench near the sidewalk watching traffic go by.
            The day was beautiful. Large fluffy clouds dotted the bright blue
            sky while a warm breeze ruffled his curls. He could live within this
            moment forever.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then his mother, his world, coughed. “Oh dear, sorry Izuku. I must
            be getting a cold from the season change! Let’s start heading back
            home in a little bit, okay?” That’s all it had been.
        </p>
        <p>
            Izuku nodded in understanding, “Yeah, okay! Hope you feel better
            soon, Mom!”
        </p>
        <p>
            “I’m sure I will, sweetie. These seasonal colds are always nothing
            anyway. Just a few days feeling a little under the weather, that’s
            all.” Inko had smiled at him without a care.
        </p>
        <p>They both didn’t know how fast the sickness would set in.</p>
        <p>
            They had barely left the park maybe an hour or two later when,
            “Izuku… I really don’t feel good. Wait up. I… I need to sit down
            again.”
        </p>
        <p>
            He turned around to stand next to where Inko had sat down in the
            grass just off the walkway. “Mom… are you okay?” People glanced at
            them while his mother struggled to catch her breath. No one stopped
            to ask if they needed help.
        </p>
        <p>
            Green bangs curtained her face as her head was tipped down. A pale
            complexion covered her skin. “I-I can’t…” Panic slightly tinged her
            voice, “Can’t breathe…” She looked up, searching for his worried
            gaze. Her beautiful emerald eyes looked dull and unfocused.
            <i>“Call 1-1-9.”</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            The world slightly faded from memory as Izuku called the emergency
            line and begged for help. The images are incoherent, not fully
            transitioning from one scene to another fluidly, but the story stays
            mostly complete regardless.
        </p>
        <p>
            He can remember the dispatcher promising help was on the way. He can
            remember when Inko was loaded into the ambulance, squeezing his hand
            for comfort. Whether it was for her or for him, he’ll never know.
        </p>
        <p>
            He can remember waiting in the hospital hallway outside her room as
            doctors hurried to and fro, forbidding him to enter in case she was
            contagious. He can remember one of the nurses handing him something
            to eat, or maybe it was Aunt Mitsuki?
        </p>
        <p>
            He can remember the sound of the flat line as he hurried into the
            room… Only to see his mother, the only one who supported him in any
            capacity, not breathing. Lying within the hospital bed, as the sun
            set behind her and bathed her in golden light.
        </p>
        <p>
            She looked so peaceful. Barely visible freckles like stardust on her
            face.
        </p>
        <p>
            He can remember crying to himself in an empty apartment. Alone. He
            doesn’t know if it was days or weeks. He only remembers coming back
            to himself enough to think again when the landlord knocked looking
            for the month’s pay.
        </p>
        <p>
            Realizing his situation, a fourteen-year-old, soon to be homeless,
            now completely alone. He remembers an email, an opportunity. The
            only one he may ever have within this unfair world.
