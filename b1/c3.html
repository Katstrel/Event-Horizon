				<b> Saturday, June 2, 2142 </b>
			</p>

			<p>
				A few days later, Izuku was entering the basement of Jaku General
				Hospital through a swirling midnight black portal with a box of his
				notebooks, knickknacks, and photos of Inko held tightly in his arms. He
				followed the short, bald man that introduced himself as Garaki Kyuudai
				at a slow pace.
			</p>

			<p>
				Dr. Garaki was very expressive despite the large mustache covering his
				mouth and giant circular goggles framing his eyes. He was talking about
				his pet, an experiment named Johnny. A creature he genetically modified
				to give a warp quirk? Fascinating.
			</p>

			<p>
				The part about modifying its mind to follow verbal commands based on the
				signature of a person&rsquo;s voice? A bit unnerving that something like
				that was even possible. He didn&rsquo;t want to know more.
			</p>

			<p>
				The hallways were set up like a maze made of concrete and metal, it
				would definitely take him a while to get used to the lay-out. Their pace
				eventually slowed as they came up to a hallway with decorated doors.
			</p>

			<p>
				Dr. Garaki moved towards the only one with a nameplate. &ldquo;Here is
				my room. If there's ever an emergency, and I'm not responding, you might
				find me in here. Feel free to claim any room near here as yours to keep
				your personal items in.&rdquo; The boy only nodded in response.
			</p>

			<p>
				Izuku moved towards an unused room. The place was bleak with gray
				concrete as the floor, white walls, and a metal frame holding up birch
				panels as the ceiling. There was a western style bed already made with
				light gray sheets and a metal desk beside it. Still feeling slightly out
				of it from recent events, he just glanced over the depressing atmosphere
				and placed the box on the hard ground near the bed.
			</p>

			<p>
				The doctor spoke up, &ldquo;The entrance to the lab is nearby. Follow
				me. Best to memorize its location quickly! You&rsquo;ll be spending a
				lot of time there with me.&rdquo;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br />
		<hr />

		<div class="patriciapoem">
			<p style="font-weight: bold" align="center">
				At first the mind resists,<br />
				Tries to hold on<br />
				To what it has known,<br />
				But it is futile<br />
				Because you chose this.
			</p>
		</div>
		<hr />
		<br />

		<div>
			<p>
				The entrance to the lab was behind a large steel door. Izuku wondered
				why it would be so secure, but his wonder wasn&rsquo;t left for long
				when he saw the giant violet vats filled with creatures beyond his
				nightmares.
			</p>

			<p>
				Many of them looked humanoid but so, so wrong. Too many eyes, teeth,
				limbs, all with a glass look to their eyes and the brain exposed on
				their head. Possibly awake within the fluid but unthinking. One even
				looked like a white dog that was only skin and bones. Unnatural.
				&ldquo;The subjects here are donated from various sources. Don&rsquo;t
				worry, who they were no longer matters. Their mind isn&rsquo;t human
				anymore after death anyway.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				That confirmed that the humanoid ones were most likely made from humans.
				Dread pooled in his gut. He knew some of those studies were ethically
				questionable, but <em>this</em>&hellip; This was on another level of
				ethics violations.
			</p>

			<p>
				Although, he should have expected something like this. He had to look
				<em>deep</em> to find some of Dr. Garaki&rsquo;s published works. The
				information complied within the tests and experiments were fascinating
				but also very disturbing sometimes. Izuku shivered at the realization of
				how much wasn&rsquo;t explained in detail.
			</p>

			<p>
				The mad scientist turned to him with a serious look in his eye.
				&ldquo;You must already understand that my research is greatly frowned
				upon. You've seen the criticisms. Are you truly dedicated to learning
				all you can about quirks? To accept the position as my assistant?&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				Izuku swallowed the slight dread in his gut. While he was given a
				choice, he also knew that there was no going back. He had nothing left
				to go back to. His mother was dead, his father missing for years, and
				his best friend wasn&rsquo;t much of a friend since they were five.
			</p>

			<p>
				Ignoring his unease, a green-haired child makes a decision that was
				already made days before when an email was sent. Possibly weeks before,
				when a dream was shattered in an underpass tunnel. He had nothing else
				but this. He was <em>worthless</em> without this. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br />
		<hr />
		<br />

		<div>
			<p>
				A creature with only the top half of its body took that moment to show
				up. It dragged itself and a large tube it was connected to at the waist
				along the floor at a pace it should not have been able to achieve. Some
				type of jar was protecting its exposed brain, while metal rods protruded
				into the curly pinkish flesh.
			</p>

			<p>Izuku, like any sane person, screamed for his life.</p>

			<p>
				The mad scientist only chuckled, &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s just Johnny. I
				think he likes you!&rdquo; The creature, Johnny, gave off an eerie
				joyful bark-like sound while wagging its waist and the tube behind it.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br />
		<hr />
		<br />

		<div>
			<p>
				Later on, Izuku sat on the bed within his new, barren room. He blankly
				stared at the white wall as thoughts raced in an incoherent manner, as
				if he had no thoughts at all. Contradictory, a state of both being true
				until one tries to observe the stream of consciousness and snaps the
				subject back to a state of being.
			</p>

			<p>
				A passing scrambled thought managed to make him look at a photo that had
				slipped from the box of his things earlier, breaking the spell he had
				been in. It was a picture of his mother and him on his most recent
				birthday.
			</p>

			<p>
				They had gone to a hero convention. He was dressed as Eraserhead, an
				underground pro hero he had recently discovered on lesser known forums,
				with a full black jumpsuit, white scarf, and yellow goggles. His mom
				mimicked Sir Nighteye with fake rectangular glasses and yellow
				highlights in her hair.
			</p>

			<p>
				He smiled at the memory, even as tears welled in his eyes. Even with all
				the crying he had done before leaving Musutafu, he wasn&rsquo;t done
				grieving her. Would he ever be?
			</p>

			<p>
				A louder sob tore from his throat that reverberated on the empty walls.
				Another reminder that this place wasn&rsquo;t his home. The door creaked
				as it opened wider than the crack Izuku had accidentally left it as. Dr.
				Garaki looked at him with a softened expression and stepped into the
				space.
			</p>

			<p>
				Izuku sniffled and watched as the old man shuffled towards him and then
				held his arms out to offer a hug. The boy couldn&rsquo;t help himself in
				taking that offer and holding onto it like a lifeline. Fully letting out
				his anguish over the unfairness of his life while the doctor rubbed
				gentle circles in his back.
			</p>

			<p>Maybe with time, this place could become his new home.</p>
		</div>

		<br />
		<hr />
		<br />

		<div>
			<p>
				Since entering the compound beneath Jaku City&rsquo;s main hospital,
				Izuku had barely left at all. He didn&rsquo;t feel the need to. Dr.
				Garaki allowed him to explore any topic of study he wanted to while he
				settled.
			</p>

			<p>
				So, he found himself scouring for documentation about all the quirks
				currently being used within the research subjects surrounding him,
				floating in large tanks. Days had been turning into weeks. Notebook
				after notebook, filled with his own copy of the data, along with
				hypotheses about drawbacks and creative applications of each quirk.
			</p>

			<p>
				One day, the doctor had been grumbling to himself about where the papers
				for a particularly strong shock absorption quirk were located when Izuku
				called out where they should be without thinking. Dr. Garaki found it in
				no time after that.
			</p>

			<p>
				The doctor gave his head a ruffle in return. He had been
				<em>useful</em>. Within the lab, he wasn&rsquo;t a worthless Deku. It
				made him feel warm and happy. He struggled to remember the last time he
				felt that way around anyone but his mother.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br />
		<hr />
		<br />

		<div>
			<p>
				It took a while before he made a mistake. A simple, avoidable mistake.
				Garaki had asked him to move vials of strange substances to another area
				within the facility. He may have grabbed too many at once.
			</p>

			<p>
				A baby blue colored liquid exploded at his feet as the glass vial it was
				stored in shattered upon the hard ground. Despite the low hum from
				machines around the place covering most noises, the sound of glass
				breaking ricocheted loudly in the open area.
			</p>

			<p>
				Garaki was over to the scene in an instant on his mobility scooter
				hooked to a track throughout the lab. A furious expression formed across
				his face as he took in the scene. &ldquo;Midoriya.&rdquo; Izuku could
				help from shrinking away from the harsh tone.
			</p>

			<p>
				&ldquo;The vial you just broke was a one of a kind copy of a
				regeneration quirk.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				Izuku paled at that. &ldquo;I-I didn&rsquo;t m-mean t-to! I&rsquo;m
				sorry!&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				&ldquo;I never wanted to do this, but you must understand the
				consequences of failing to be careful with fragile items and
				disrespecting my requests. Johnny, send Midoriya to a conditioning
				chamber.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				Before Izuku could fully register what was happening, slime bubbled up
				his throat.
				<em
					>He was in the underpass tunnel. A mocking voice sounded in his ears,
					&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just hijacking your body, calm down. It&rsquo;ll only
					hurt for about forty-five seconds&hellip; Then it&rsquo;ll all be
					over.&rdquo;</em
				>
			</p>

			<p>
				In only a few seconds, Izuku landed harshly on a white tiled floor.
				Coughing up nonexistent fluid from his lungs. He curled up into himself
				to banish the memory faster. Shaking from having to relive the sensation
				of drowning before All Might saved him.
			</p>

			<p>
				When he finally calmed down, he looked at the cell he was in. White tile
				encompassed the entire room on the floor, walls, and ceiling. Parts of
				the tile were stained with a reddish brown hue, and other parts had long
				gouges as if large claws raked against the walls.
			</p>

			<p>
				<em>Conditioning chamber</em>. What could this space possibly be
				conditioning for? The claw marks and blood pointed towards the noumu.
				Were they violent when not suspended in the purple fluid they were kept
				in? That's a terrifying new thought.
			</p>

			<p>
				Why had Garaki sent him here as punishment? He began to realize why as
				time ticked on within the room. It was boring. There was nothing to do.
				Nothing to see, to hear, to feel except the tile. It strained his senses
				until he could hear his own heartbeat.
			</p>

			<p>
				He became hungry and thirsty, but time continued to march on with
				nothing happening. Nothing to mark a passage of time. Was he here for
				minutes? No, he was starving. Hours then? Who knows. It couldn&rsquo;t
				be more than three days, as he hadn&rsquo;t had water the entire time.
			</p>

			<p>
				It startled him when sludge finally burst from his mouth again, and he
				found himself disorientated on the ground in front of Garaki. A hand
				comfortingly found itself in his green curls as he was shoved food and
				water. He leaned into the kind touch as he ravaged the protein bar
				handed to him.
			</p>

			<p>
				Garaki had been kind, almost welcoming within the cold, desolate aura of
				the lab and surrounding compound. Now, Izuku also knew he would give
				punishment without hesitation if he ever messed up again. He would try
				his best to not make another mistake.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br />
		<hr />
		<br />

		<div>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Doctor.&rdquo; A smooth voice rumbled throughout the lab. Even
				with the metallic ring that betrayed the owner&rsquo;s weakness, the low
				baritone carried a weight that demanded respect. A dangerous edge to it,
				no matter how friendly its tone may be.
			</p>

			<p><em>Lord All for One. </em></p>

			<p>
				Dr. Garaki seemed to worship the man and had impressed on Izuku that he
				should give the utmost respect to his Lord or suffer severe
				consequences. When surrounded by nightmarish creatures created from
				preserved bodies and faced with the white tile chamber, he didn't have
				to be told twice.
			</p>

			<p>
				Ceasing from writing within his notebook in a mostly hidden nook he had
				claimed as his on the main lab floor, he quietly listened. Dr. Garaki
				knows he likes to hang out up there, out of the way. It&rsquo;s a small
				area, clearly some type of observation deck or old loft.
			</p>

			<p>
				When he first discovered it, it had been so dusty that he thought no one
				had been up there in decades. Dr. Garaki had hinted that even he may
				have forgotten about the space. Perfect for a little hideaway.
			</p>

			<p>
				He managed to spruce the space up by asking his mentor for blankets and
				pillows and other soft things. Short bookshelves held notebooks, pens,
				pencils, and some of the trinkets that he had brought with him when
				leaving Musutafu. He even had a string of fairy lights to give off a
				dim, warm glow that failed to escape his glorified blanket fort near the
				rafters. He had his own room, yes, but this was his space that only him
				and the doctor knew of.
			</p>

			<p>
				&ldquo;When will I meet that new assistant you mentioned a while
				back?&rdquo; Upon that indirect request, Izuku quietly scrambled up from
				his resting position and leaped for a pole he loved using to get down
				from the loft. It lacked any wires or tubes wrapped around it like other
				support poles and columns within the area.
			</p>

			<p>
				He landed with a quiet thud, hidden under the loud hum of electricity
				powering the vats and main terminal. A breathing apparatus floated
				leisurely behind the tall man, connecting to the center of his neck with
				a thick tube. Izuku moved to stand beside Dr. Garaki before bowing
				deeply, even with the slight anxietycrawling in his chest.
			</p>

			<p>
				Although, when did fear and anxiety ever not buzz in his veins?
				&ldquo;M-Midoriya Izuku, p-pleasure to m-meet you, my Lord.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				He looked like a simple, casual businessman with a three-piece suit,
				albeit lacking a tie. He knew the man was bound to be anything but
				simple. Especially when his entire head was scarred over from an old
				injury that should have been fatal from the looks of it. His hand was
				held out in the western way of greeting, or as if to make a deal, only
				served to sell the illusion more.
			</p>

			<p>
				In the center of his palm sits a miniature black hole. Given that
				markings usually accompany the quirk factor, whatever quirk the man had
				was located in his hands. A test.
			</p>

			<p>Izuku takes All for One&rsquo;s outstretched hand.</p>

			<p>
				The imposing man that only had a mouth for a face, smiled with all teeth
				and hummed before speaking once more, &ldquo;I see he has good manners,
				excellent choice, Good Doctor. Well, Midoriya-kun, I shall look forward
				to our possible partnership in the future.&rdquo;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br />
		<hr />
		<br />

		<div>
			<p>
				At some point, Izuku&rsquo;s duties had been upgraded. Rather than
				moving vials and paperwork around, Garaki now expected him to help dump
				solutions into the vats for various projects. The solutions held a type
				of germ that would go into cells and add the Alpha Elements to the
				subject&rsquo;s DNA for a specific quirk. Another agent would be added
				in later to help force manifestation of the new quirk.
			</p>

			<p>
				He had managed to swipe some blood and sequence some of the
				noumu&rsquo;s DNA to see the difference in action. It was fascinating
				that a change in a couple spots in the genome helped encode for a new
				quirk.
			</p>

			<p>
				Even more curious was All for One&rsquo;s quirk, also named
				<em>All for One</em>. It could transfer already manifested quirks
				between subjects in less than a minute. Although, it didn&rsquo;t change
				the subjects&rsquo; DNA like how Garaki&rsquo;s method did. He had yet
				to figure out how the quirk worked.
			</p>

			<p>
				Really it ended up more annoying than anything to him because he wanted
				to sequence DNA and sometimes the genes for a quirk would be there, but
				the actual quirk <em>wasn&rsquo;t</em> or vice versa. He could rant for
				ages over how many times that has happened, but Garaki would definitely
				not accept any ill talk of the other ancient man.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br />
		<hr />
		<br />

		<div>
			<p>
				Despite the doctor&rsquo;s best efforts to encourage Izuku into
				designing his own noumu, he had managed to refuse every single time
				without punishment. Although, he couldn&rsquo;t help himself from
				pointing out any mistakes within quirk combinations for the doctor.
			</p>

			<p>
				As the months went by, Izuku was learning more than the mysteries of
				quirk factors. He had picked up tinkering as a hobby.
			</p>

			<p>
				It had started with stealing forgotten parts to the machines littering
				the lab, until Garaki caught him in the act of taking screws and metal
				bits up to another area near the rafters. Since then, Garaki supplied
				him with all the metal and wire he might want. He was working on trying
				to make his own hologram technology.
			</p>

			<p>
				Part of this new hobby also introduced him to programming. His mentor
				got excited about that and quickly enrolled him in an anonymous course
				for hacking. He had used the skills he was learning there to test the
				doctor&rsquo;s cybersecurity. Due to having physical access to the
				laboratory&rsquo;s terminal, he conquered that very quickly and found a
				folder full of what the doctor would later tell him are
				&lsquo;memes&rsquo; and &lsquo;vines&rsquo; from his youth. Weird old
				man.
			</p>

			<p>
				After that incident, Garaki properly taught him how to use the terminal
				to control the laboratory, compound, and branch locations across the
				country. He was the only staff besides his mentor within the main lab,
				but other locations were manned by scientists and researchers employed
				by the Good Doctor and All for One.
			</p>

			<p>
				Izuku quietly swore as he accidentally supplied too much voltage to the
				motherboard he was working on, <em>again</em>. He stood up from the
				floor of his workshop loft with the board in hand.
				<em>&ldquo;YEET!&rdquo;</em> A bang as the fried motherboard made its
				home in the dumpster across the lab, and then a heavy sigh from a man
				over a century old.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br />
		<hr />
		<br />

		<div>
			<p>
				Someone was screaming. It wasn&rsquo;t the normal roars, chitters, and
				snarling that the noumu would make when awake outside the vats. It
				sounded like raw terror, grating against his nerves, wanting to make him
				curl up in a corner till it passed.
			</p>

			<p>
				This had happened several times before. Usually it sounded like the
				angry yelling or low cursing that was distinctly human. Izuku never
				wandered close, preferring to hide away in his room. The Good Doctor
				worked during those times. The maniac gleam in his eyes sometimes
				unsettled him, as he was reminded of how much the man is a mad scientist
				with few morals left in his long life.
			</p>

			<p>
				This time was different. Garaki stood in his doorway, requesting him to
				come help with the newest subject. He knew he couldn&rsquo;t say no. As
				he stepped forward to follow his master, Garaki gave him a hair ruffle.
				He was being useful. He still brightened at the positive touch, despite
				the trepidation crawling within him.
			</p>

			<p>
				Upon arriving at the main lab, he found that it was a young woman
				screaming. She was chained to an examination table with her wrists and
				ankles. She had lilac skin and curly black hair that framed her magenta
				eyes. Two small horns curved up over her head just over slightly pointed
				ears. A pointed tail whipped around in her clear distress.
			</p>

			<p>
				When she finally sighted them, her screams of terror quickly switched to
				the usual anger and cursing he often heard. &ldquo;You! When I get out
				of here, I&rsquo;ll tear ya weak shit pond limb from fucking limb. Oh
				great, you brought a kid this time too. What, gonna torture us both?
				Kid, run!&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				Garaki slammed a metal stick against the table, creating a harsh ringing
				sound. The woman shut up for a moment after that. &ldquo;The kid is my
				assistant, now be quiet. Midoriya, grab that yellow syringe of paralytic
				and inject her.&rdquo; Izuku hesitated, he had never been present for
				this kind of <em>project</em>. &ldquo;Now.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				White tile flashed in his memory, he really couldn&rsquo;t say no. The
				lilac woman looked on in horror as he grabbed the syringe and worked to
				find a vein within her forearm. &ldquo;Oh god, you&rsquo;re actually
				working for him. How? Why? What did he do to you?&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				He wanted to ignore her, to ignore this situation, but he couldn&rsquo;t
				help in responding to her question. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t do anything
				to me besides give me a home. A place to belong. This is repaying his
				kindness.&rdquo; It was true. He had nothing outside the compound. He
				was the useless, worthless Deku that no one wanted around. Here, he was
				finally <em>Midoriya</em> and he was <em>worth something</em>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Garaki turned his attention back to them, &ldquo;I thought I told the
				subject to be quiet, don&rsquo;t encourage it.&rdquo; Izuku paused at
				that, <em>it</em>. Calling this lady <em>it</em> right in front of her.
				Not even to her. Something snapped within him as his morals were deeply
				challenged once again. Even if she was an unwilling test subject to an
				experiment, she deserved to be recognized as a person. Really, Izuku had
				no clue what these projects involving real people involved.
			</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Master Garaki, what are we doing exactly?&rdquo;</p>

			<p>
				&ldquo;Oh right, I didn&rsquo;t brief you. This will be the base for a
				new noumu. The paralytic will stop it from squirming as much while the
				injections work to insert the DNA. After an hour, we can kick-start the
				manifestation process.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				&ldquo;A n-noumu? She&rsquo;ll become a noumu? As b-brain-dead as the
				rest?&rdquo; The lady&rsquo;s eyes widened at that, yet she said
				nothing. It felt like part of him always knew this was a possibility.
				That not all the noumu were dead before their use as experiments began.
				He never wanted to acknowledge the possibility before. He
				<em>couldn&rsquo;t.</em>
			</p>

			<p>
				Garaki responded, &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; A nonchalant tone making it seem
				like this was another Tuesday. It probably was, and that slightly
				horrified Izuku once more. &ldquo;This is Subject MZ-3607.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				A small voice rose up from him, &ldquo;This is wrong. She&rsquo;s still
				alive.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				Garaki fully turned to stare him down, &ldquo;Are you questioning
				me?&rdquo; <em>Was he? He was.</em> The green haired boy nodded, he
				would say no this time. Damn the consequences. The doctor hummed,
				&ldquo;Very well. Ruben,&rdquo; A boar-like humanoid perked up from the
				corner of the room. &ldquo;Restrain Midoriya and make sure he&rsquo;s
				silent.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				The noumu caught him and covered his mouth from behind before he could
				even process the command. He could breathe, thankfully, but being at the
				mercy of the hulking half-pig noumu severely unnerved him.
			</p>

			<p>
				He was forced to watch and listen as Garaki continued the
				<em>experiment</em>. At one point, he tried to fight off the noumu, but
				that rewarded him with his own dose of the paralytic. Forced to listen
				as she cried about how much it burned, as if burning from the inside
				out, as a quirk germ mixture was injected.
			</p>

			<p>
				He watched as her body shivered even while under the heavy paralysis of
				whatever the yellow drug was. Hated that a small part of him was
				fascinated by the process and didn't want to look away, despite how much
				the rest of him protested. Saw the moment the light started to leave her
				eyes as claws and spikes burst forth from her hands and spine.
			</p>

			<p>
				Briefly, he thought he was dying with her as slime bubbled in his throat
				till he was greeted with the sight of scarred and blood-stained white
				tile. Left alone with only his thoughts to accompany him. Even though he
				said no, it still happened, and he was forced to watch. Now trapped in
				this Kami-forsaken room once again.
			</p>

			<p>
				He doesn&rsquo;t know how long he was there. Didn&rsquo;t check the date
				before the incident and lost count of how many protein bars and bottles
				of water were brought to him through a swirling black portal. The trash
				was always taken from him as he finished, likely a video feed at the
				terminal to monitor him.
			</p>

			<p>
				At the end of it all, he couldn&rsquo;t help but embrace the empty
				apologies, relax within the cold hugs, and savor the attention his
				master gave him afterward. The punishment was his fault to begin with
				for being such a useless Deku once more. He had been so good, why did he
				defy the only person who cared for him?
			</p>

			<p>The next time something like that happened, he didn&rsquo;t resist.</p>
		</div>

		<br />
		<hr />
		<br />

		<div>
			<p>
				It was almost the new year. Izuku and Dr. Garaki sat within the lab
				watching ancient vines on the massive terminal screen while eating fried
				chicken. It was peaceful, as the hum of the purple tanks filled with
				grotesque creatures provided a calming background noise.
			</p>

			<p>
				He threw a clean chicken bone at Johnny and the dog like noumu missed as
				it hit his face just below the jar. He blinked, one eye then the other,
				before remembering the bone now in front of him, swallowing it whole.
			</p>

			<p>
				All for One had dumped a body in front of Garaki a few days ago like
				some sort of holiday present. Although, more akin to a cat leaving a
				bird for its human as a gift. Great, now he can&rsquo;t unsee the man as
				a giant cat. His voice even nearly purrs with how low it rumbles. Better
				never have that thought anywhere near him, lest he wants to die.
				<em>Poor little meow meow&hellip;</em> f u c k<em>.</em>
			</p>

				Throwing another bone at Johnny, Izuku stands up to start heading back
				to his room. He&rsquo;s clearly too tired to think properly any more
				tonight. Before he leaves, Dr. Garaki reaches over and ruffles his hair
				while smiling softly. &ldquo;Have a good night, Midoriya, tomorrow
				I&rsquo;d like for you to join me on a new project.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>Izuku smiled brightly. He would be useful.</p>

				Izuku woke up early the next morning and took the time for himself. A
				nice long shower followed by curling up within a soft blanket dressed in
				comfy clothes. A star covered notebook laid in front of him as he
				doodled different heroes from his <em>Analysis</em> notebooks.
			</p>

			<p>
				He eventually moved on to sketching his mom. Dozens of sketches already
				covered the small shrine he set up within his room for her, but he
				couldn&rsquo;t help continuing to draw her. It was a small way for him
				to remember her as he slowly moved on.
			</p>

			<p>
				Kacchan was also drawn within his notebooks here and there, despite
				their last interaction not being that great.
				<em>&ldquo;Pray for a quirk in your next life!&rdquo;</em> He winced at
				the memory. They had been together since they were babies, practically
				brothers. Izuku found himself missing the angry blond. Although, Kacchan
				was probably happy for him to finally be out of his way.
			</p>

			<p>
				When he started to feel hungry, he made a small breakfast of egg and
				crab rice balls within the small kitchen area he made for himself within
				the room. After that, he dressed into jeans, his old red sneakers, and a
				neon yellow shirt that had &lsquo;socks&rsquo; written on it in English.
				There was also a white lab coat that he sometimes slipped on if Master
				Garaki wanted him to wear it.
			</p>

			<p>
				Finally, in the late morning, Garaki came by to lead him to a more
				remote area within the compound. He had no clue what this new project
				would require, he silently hoped it was just managing another batch of
				noumu within the vats.
			</p>

			<p>
				They slowed as they entered a room with only one large tank. Nothing was
				in it, not even the purple suspension liquid. He was probably needed to
				help prepare the area today. It took less than an hour to get the
				compound&rsquo;s system to start pouring solution into the tank and
				manually run the thick cabling to control the new vat.
			</p>

			<p>
				Once that was done, Garaki pulled out a vial that swirled with an inky
				black that seemed to reflect no light except for the shine of the glass.
				&ldquo;Only one quirk for this experiment. The first phase of this
				project requires that we make sure this quirk can even be copied
				successfully. I&rsquo;ve chosen the best candidate for success out of
				all the batches I produced for this.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				Izuku hummed to show he was listening before speaking up after a moment,
				&ldquo;So, the project is important enough to be this remote from the
				rest? What&rsquo;s it called?&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				&ldquo;Adonis. We&rsquo;ll begin shortly after lunch. Go eat up and meet
				back here in an hour.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				Garaki left at a fast pace on his mobility track, leaving Izuku to stare
				up at the new project site before turning to leave as well. Lunch was a
				short affair that he mostly spent relaxing within his room. More doodles
				filled his notebook by the end of the hour, this time of constellations
				he found in a book.
			</p>

			<p>
				Upon re-entering the location for Adonis, Master Garaki scurried over to
				him without the assist chair. The doctor reached up to ruffle his green
				curls, Izuku slightly leaning into the touch, as the man started
				speaking, &ldquo;The test subject is actually quite special as well.
				After all, even though this is the test run phase for Adonis to prove
				the concept as viable, the subject will benefit greatly from this
				phase&rsquo;s success.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				Garaki shifted his position to stand slightly behind him as he continued
				to give Izuku the positive attention and touch he had craved from others
				nearly all his life. Hugs from his mother were few and far between to
				truly satisfy the craving for touch, for connection. Apprehension
				slightly iced his bones, warning him that something was off with Garaki.
			</p>

			<p>
				He opted to ignore the feeling, Garaki was <em>safe</em>. The doctor
				continued, &ldquo;I chose the best quirk germ from the batch because
				I&rsquo;d rather not lose this subject to a malfunction. So&hellip;
				let&rsquo;s get you prepared for Alpha Element insertion, shall
				we?&rdquo; The language shift was the final warning he got before a
				sharp prick was felt at the base of his neck.
			</p>

			<p>
				Izuku staggered away from the Good Doctor. Confusion muddled his
				thoughts into an incoherent mess of betrayal and fear. He turned to look
				at the man that just injected him with a serum. The man he nearly saw as
				a father figure after all these months. A source of comfort even when he
				feared disobeying the man. A soft smile rested on his face, as if he was
				unbothered by drugging the boy with the very syringe in his hand.
				<em>Why would he be?</em>
			</p>

			<p>
				Darkness encroached on his vision as he struggled to stay awake. The
				futile fight against the drowsiness over taking him by the second as he
				fell to his hands and knees. His master said something again, but he
				couldn&rsquo;t make it out. His mother came to mind, he missed her so
				much. Would he be joining her?
			</p>

			<p>
				In less than ten seconds since the injection, Izuku&rsquo;s awareness of
				the world was fully snuffed out. He didn&rsquo;t even feel his body
				slump to the ground, already entrapped within the void of medicated
				sleep.

				Red eyes looked up at the towering gates of UA High School, the best
				hero school in the country. A sea of people passed him by. Today was the
				entrance exams. A chilly breeze ruffled his spiky sand colored hair.
				Katsuki was the only one from Aldera Junior High here today. This is
				what he had always wanted. His perfect origin story. Why did it feel so
				wrong?
			</p>

			<p style="font-style: italic">
				<em>
					Let&rsquo;s be heroes! Together, Kacchan! The best hero duo ever!
				</em>
			</p>

			<p>
				It had been nine months since Auntie Inko passed away. Nine months since
				Izuku disappeared. Katsuki was still unbalanced by the loss.
				<strike><em>Was it his fault?</em></strike> He had <em>always</em> been
				there! No matter how much he hated him,
				<strike><em>did he really hate him?</em></strike> The nerd was always
				nearby, a constant <strike><em>presence</em></strike> nuisance in his
				life. Where was he? Why did he leave him behind without saying anything?
				<strike><em>He wanted to cry.</em></strike>
			</p>

			<p>
				He stepped through the gates without anyone calling out his name on his
				heels. Just like he had always dreamed of&hellip;
			</p>

			<p><em>Why had he wanted this?</em></p>
