				<b>Tuesday, February 26, 2143</b>
			</p>

			<p>
				The world came back slowly. Awareness floundering through molasses,
				trying to escape the sticky embrace of unconsciousness. His sight was
				tinged with purple as dark figures moved around outside the bubble of
				his universe. His chest moved to take a deep breath through his
				nose&ndash;
			</p>

			<p>
				<em
					>He was drowning. The thick sludge held him in place as it infiltrated
					his nose, his mouth, even his ears. He clawed at his mouth and throat,
					trying to dislodge the intruder. Trying to </em
				>breathe<em>. Every second felt futile.</em>
			</p>

			<p>
				&ndash;He breathed in stale air that tasted of chemicals and coughed out
				the purple solution always present within the giant tanks around the
				laboratory. A deep voice purred above where he was likely sprawled
				across the floor face down, &ldquo;Doctor, your newest pet seems to have
				survived! Very nice to meet you, Yami.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				A large hand settled across his forehead, a strange sense of something
				looking deep within him overcame him. Before he could try to move away
				from the offending sensation, it went away as All for One stood up once
				more. &ldquo;Doctor! Prepare for the next phase of Adonis if you would.
				We make our move this year with this splendid success of yours.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				Yami winced slightly at the headache that was starting to make itself
				known. Struggling to only get his hands and knees under him. How long
				had he been in the tank to be so weak? Low voices drifted over to him
				from near a terminal controlling the tank he had been in. Master Garaki
				and All for One discussed something he couldn&rsquo;t make out.
			</p>

			<p>
				He closed his eyes and focused back on himself. His brain felt like mush
				while his eyes were on fire. The headache was worsening by the second,
				making him want to curl up till it passed. Even his hands felt like they
				were being stabbed repeatably. Taking deep breaths to ground himself, he
				tried to push up once more.
			</p>

			<p>
				At some point the doctor came over to him, &ldquo;Yami, enough.
				Relax.&rdquo; He felt slightly compelled to listen to his master, but he
				didn&rsquo;t want to. He would stand. At least, that was his thought
				process shortly before a prick at the base of his neck was felt, and
				conscious thought blinked out of existence.
			</p>

		<div>
			<p>
				Yami awoke within his room, curled up in soft green blankets on a
				western style bed with a metal frame. Fairy lights were strung up along
				the ceiling, giving a comforting warm glow that dimly lit the room
				enough to see objects in the low light.
			</p>

			<p>
				The pain he vaguely remembered from before was gone. Likely from the
				remnants of manifesting a quirk. He remembered reading how
				manifestations were usually accompanied by discomfort or pain in the
				Alpha Element areas. Forced manifestations amplified that pain, the
				stress too much for the mind or body. Many don&rsquo;t survive without
				medical care.
			</p>

			<p>
				He continued to lay in the comfortable atmosphere for several more
				minutes before getting up to shower. Several pops left his unused joints
				as he stood up and stretched. Although, he did a double check as he
				passed the mirror. His appearance felt wrong, yet right. Yami
				couldn&rsquo;t place why, though. Did he look different before?
			</p>

			<p>
				Vibrant green irises stared back. A woman with the same shade of eyes
				briefly came to mind, confusing him. <em>Who was she?</em> He quickly
				dismissed the thought and focused back to how the pupils of his eyes
				seemed to be shaped like diamonds. Like four pointed stars. He loved the
				night sky.
			</p>

			<p>
				Freckles lightly dusted the area below his eyes, faded as if he
				hadn&rsquo;t seen the sun in a long time. Green and white loose curls
				framed his face as it spilled over his head. Had his hair bleached from
				the stress of the manifestation?
			</p>

			<p>
				It was a little while later as he finished getting dressed for the day,
				in black jeans and a shirt that had humored him with &lsquo;hat&rsquo;
				written in English on the front, that he noticed some type of marking on
				his palm that struck him as wrong yet right too. He thinks they
				weren&rsquo;t there before.
			</p>

			<p>
				He remembered how his hands hurt like hell when he had briefly awoken.
				This was likely his new quirk. A tiny perfect circle sat in the middle
				of Yami&rsquo;s palms that seemed to reflect no light at all. Miniature
				black holes.
			</p>

			<p>
				He had seen this before. On a man that towered above all others. A man
				almost always seen in a suit, exuding power and dominance. A man without
				a face except for a mouth that smiled with all teeth.
			</p>

			<p>Yami had <em>All for One</em>.</p>

			<p>
				Confusion laced his mind, how did he have <em>that</em> quirk? Was All
				for One his father? No, he refused to even entertain that idea. Was it
				possible he injected himself with quirk germ and forgot? He did seem to
				be forgetting details since waking up. Did his master do it? The last he
				remembered, it was around New Years.
			</p>

			<p>
				He was missing something, something big. Too much felt
				<em>wrong</em> since he woke up. A strange feeling nagged at his mind,
				and he relaxed. Everything was right. Everything was okay and how it
				should be. The Good Doctor gave him a quirk, that is all that happened.
				Relax.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br />

		<br />

		<div>
			<p>
				A green and white haired teen stepped into the main laboratory floor
				within the bleak underground compound. Right away, the doctor called for
				him to come over near the terminal. Yami followed without a thought. A
				light purple noumu stood off to the side of Master Garaki with horns
				sprouting from just above its ears and a spiked tail laying limp against
				the ground. It itched at his mind, but he ignored it.
			</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Yami, take the storage quirk from this noumu.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>
				Compelled to do so and on only what must have been instinct newly
				ingrained within his mind, he reached a hand forward and placed it on
				the creature&rsquo;s exposed brain. Cyan and black energy floated up
				around him, idly twisting in the air as he marveled at it.
				<em>He actually had a quirk</em>.
			</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Yami.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>
				He focused back to the task he was given. Energy thrummed within his
				veins, wishing to be commanded, even though he didn&rsquo;t know how to.
				Closing his eyes, he focused on the new feeling and willed whatever it
				was to become stronger. It responded by screeching within his bones,
				rattling his mind, protesting harshly to whatever he did. Like it tried
				to grab at something within him when there was only itself.
			</p>

			<p>
				He staggered back from the pain before admitting, &ldquo;I- I
				don&rsquo;t know how.&rdquo; <em>Useless</em>. Finally had a quirk and
				he couldn&rsquo;t even control it. A hand landed within his curls before
				he could continue to spiral in similar deprecating thoughts.
			</p>

			<p>
				Looking up, his master gave him his usual soft smile. &ldquo;Then take
				it with you and report back to me once you do. Although, don&rsquo;t
				take too long.&rdquo; With that new directive, Yami led the small demon
				like noumu up to a loft space above the terminal he vaguely remembered
				being there.
			</p>

			<p>
				Resolved to make his master proud, he set forth to calling
				<em>All for One</em> over and over. Pain slowly built up within his
				head, failure after failure. It was hours later that he finally realized
				that he could feel an echo of different energy from the noumu when he
				touched it with his quirk active.
			</p>

			<p>
				Closing his eyes, he focused all he could on that new feeling of energy
				under his hand. It was a jumbled mess of sensations. His gut instinct
				once again compelled him to call upon <em>All for One</em>, as if
				directing it to reach for this new energy too.
			</p>

			<p>
				Colors exploded in front of his mind&rsquo;s vision. Lilac, yellow,
				magenta, and sky blue shone brightly within a void. Like brilliant
				little stars lighting up the abyss of space. It was beautiful and at the
				same time startled Yami enough to drop his hold on his quirk completely.
			</p>

			<p>
				Reinvigorated by that brief success, he repeated the process and
				<em>reached</em>. The four stars illuminated the space around him as all
				awareness of the outside world faded away. He could move around as if he
				was awake within the space, but he also had an idea that he was sitting,
				unmoving, in the real world. Surreal.
			</p>

			<p>
				He lightly touched the sky blue star out of curiosity. It lightly
				burned, the energy it emitted crackling around his fingertips as he did
				so. A vague sense of weightlessness accompanied the feeling. The
				sensations faded away as he withdrew from the light.
			</p>

			<p>
				Out of curiosity, he touched the others. The lilac sent an unpleasant
				feeling around his spine and skull. The yellow made his skin buzz with a
				cooling effect that stung yet felt good. Lastly, the magenta pressed
				imaginary weight against his bones. It was fascinating.
			</p>

			<p>
				Thinking back to the matter at hand, how would he take a quirk? So far,
				<em>All for One</em>, had been a very mentally orientated quirk. It had
				responded to him just willing it to do something. So, he tried again. He
				focused his attention on the new energy within his veins and willed it
				to tug at the feeling of weightlessness.
			</p>

			<p>
				He awoke to the real world as it responded. Cyan and black energy
				whisked around, no longer only in the air but running through the skin
				and flesh of himself and the noumu. It lasted about a minute or two
				before a weightless feeling fluttered in his skin and steadily grew to a
				dull ache.
			</p>

			<p>
				Yami had no clue if this was even the right quirk, nor how to test if it
				was. For now, he grabbed one of the blankets within the loft and laid
				down to sleep off the ache in his head and bones. He could continue
				experimenting another time.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br />
		<hr />
		<br />

		<div>
			<p>
				The teen awoke next with barely any aches to accompany him. The noumu
				slightly tilted its head to the side as if to greet him, or maybe he was
				trying to personify creatures with hardly any autonomy left. Either way,
				Yami immediately began to work on using his second quirk.
			</p>

			<p>
				Nothing prompted him this time on how to use it like
				<em>All for One</em> did. Was it because he fully manifested that quirk,
				while this one was gained with the use of his quirk? Did DNA actually
				encode instincts like that for quirk use? Interesting. If Alpha Elements
				existed for instinctive quirk use, then what if someone had a quirk but
				lacked that instinct?
			</p>

			<p>
				He didn&rsquo;t have any clue what activation would even look like.
				Sighing, he tried something similar to what he did for
				<em>All for One</em>. Focusing within himself with his eyes closed, he
				felt his quirk but also the energy of the other, a sense of
				weightlessness. He tried to will it to react, nothing. Surely some type
				of storage quirk would have a mental component? Or was this a physical
				one? &hellip; His master didn&rsquo;t say.
			</p>

			<p>
				Switching tactics, he opened his eyes and picked up a pencil from the
				ground nearby. He stared down the object intensely, mentally trying to
				get the quirk to respond at all. Still nothing. He groaned and let
				himself fall against the pile of blankets below him. Could he even use
				quirks he gathered with his own? Lord All for One could from what he
				could tell in his faulty memories.
			</p>

			<p>
				He turned his attention back to the feeling of power in his veins.
				<em>All for One</em> sat at the forefront, a void that was strangely
				comforting. Nothing like the true emptiness of being quirkless that he
				could only now identify after having something fill that space close to
				his soul. The storage quirk murmured in the background. It felt as if it
				was inside <em>All for One</em>.
			</p>

			<p>
				This time, Yami activated his quirk first, then willed the quirk inside
				to be stronger. It roared to life as the void of his own quirk curled
				around its light. The sensations were nearly overpowering. His heart
				leapt in his throat as he fell <em>upwards</em>, harshly landing in the
				rafters, thankfully only a few meters above him.
			</p>

			<p>&hellip;</p>

			<p><em>For fuck&rsquo;s sake, he had the wrong quirk.</em></p>
		</div>

		<br />
		<hr />
		<br />

		<div>
			<p>
				The storage quirk ended up being the one that felt like added weight.
				His bones felt like they turned to lead when he used it for the first
				time. Barely being able to move after his testing pencil disappeared
				with a flicker of pink light.
			</p>

			<p>
				He finally returned to Master Garaki after another quick nap. He told
				him to keep the quirk as a reward for figuring out how to use
				<em>All for One</em>. Summoning and storing notebooks with
				<em>Pocket</em> quickly became like muscle memory to him in the days
				after.
			</p>

			<p>
				Yami had found a notebook titled <em>Analysis #14</em> that had a black
				cover with gold constellations connecting small stars. In the center sat
				a gold circle with tapered points off each end, giving the illusion of a
				tilt to the object. A smaller circular ring and a line parallel along
				the points cut through the gold to leave the original black.
			</p>

			<p>
				He showed it to Master Garaki, asking for another copy of the same
				notebook. A few days later, a blank notebook was in his hands. He
				didn&rsquo;t title it this time. It didn&rsquo;t need one, as he knew
				exactly what this book was for.
			</p>

			<p>
				Analysis on his own quirk and every quirk he would acquire. The black
				hole, stars, and constellation imagery was quite fitting. Stars and
				quirks were quite similar to him, after all.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br />
		<hr />
		<br />

		<div>
			<p>
				&ldquo;Yami, transfer that recent fang quirk to this noumu
				instead.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				He barely even noticed the slight compelling sense that accompanied the
				request, too used to the feeling and seeing no reason to resist.
				&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; It helped that he didn&rsquo;t mind lending a hand,
				it made him feel useful, like he was worth something to someone. Wanted.
			</p>

			<p>
				Over the past month or two, Yami had improved his use of the transfer
				aspect of <em>All for One</em>. His time to complete a transfer slowly
				dwindled down to less than a minute. He could also stay aware within the
				real world while using his quirk.
			</p>

			<p>
				A cyan and black glow surrounded him as he walked over to the noumu in
				question, climbing up to the opening in the top to reach in and lay his
				hand on the creature. He had transferred the fang quirk to this noumu
				before, and quickly identified the feeling of it to <em>pull</em>.
			</p>

			<p>
				His teeth, specifically the canines, seemed to buzz as he held the
				quirk. If he didn&rsquo;t give it to another creature within several
				minutes, the pain would slowly build as the manifestation started.
				Transferring quirks used to make him tired as well, but he&rsquo;s
				gotten used to the feeling and ignored the tiredness that weighed on
				him. Slowly building a resistance to the drowsiness.
			</p>

			<p>
				A few times, he tried messing with the quirks as he briefly had them,
				but quickly found out that calling for the quirks forces the
				manifestation. It was <em>very</em> fast and potentially
				<em>very</em> painful. To be honest, he was lucky that
				<em>Pocket</em> had only made him feel very lethargic rather than in
				pain the first time he used it.
			</p>

			<p>
				One of the most notable times making that mistake had been with a snow
				quirk, the ability to summon snow around the user with a secondary
				antler mutation. Growing antlers within a few seconds nearly knocked him
				out and caused his control to slip so that he covered the entire lab
				floor in several centimeters of snow in his shock. He also learned that
				giving away a manifested quirk resulted in a similar but subdued pain or
				discomfort as well.
			</p>

			<p>
				Jumping down from the raised platform behind two rows of tanks and
				successfully not tripping on any wires or pipes, he made his way back to
				his master. This time the creature was more dog-like than anything
				humanoid. Yami would dare say it was kind of cute how grotesque it was.
				The bug eyes reminiscent of a pug sold it, really.
			</p>

			<p>
				Transferring the fang quirk did not help the creature&rsquo;s case. The
				new teeth looked slightly crooked in its mouth, with the underbite
				showing one of the fangs.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br />
		<hr />
		<br />

		<div>
			<p>
				A child was crying within the compound. It rubbed Yami the wrong way.
				Nearly every part of him wanted to go comfort them, but something in his
				mind was stopping him. This was probably the work of the Good Doctor. He
				would only get in the way. Eventually, his pager beeped as the doctor
				called him to come to a smaller area not far from the main floor.
			</p>

			<p>
				The child was here, the crying quieted with his arrival. Chained to the
				floor by his wrists behind his back and blindfolded. It was a small boy,
				maybe around eight, with long gray hair. The doctor stood nearby at a
				desk, papers strewn around him. &ldquo;This is a boy from one of the
				nearby orphanages. I&rsquo;ve had my eye on him for a while, and I think
				it&rsquo;s time you got a new quirk, Yami. Take it.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				&ldquo;No! Please! Someone, anyone! Help me!&rdquo; The visceral fear
				from the small boy gave him pause, even with the intense feeling of
				<em>want</em>. The need to comfort someone in need arose to the
				forefront of his mind. It was always easier for him to care more for
				others than himself.
			</p>

			<p>
				He held out against the feeling, about to offer words of comfort before,
				&ldquo;Yami.&rdquo; The doctor&rsquo;s tone was stern.
			</p>

			<p>
				Thoughts became muddy, the sensation of weightlessness and darkness came
				to mind. Like how he would image floating in space would be like. When
				awareness trickled back, the boy was screaming in pain, begging for him
				to give something back. <em>The quirk</em>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Terror filled Yami&rsquo;s veins. He didn&rsquo;t remember taking the
				quirk. He blacked out. <em>What was that?</em> Could
				<em>All for One</em> control him? Would he one day find himself forever
				trapped inside his own quirk? Truly brain-dead, like the surrounding
				creatures in the compound?
			</p>

			<p><em>Was he turning into one of them?</em></p>
		</div>

		<br />
		<hr />
		<br />

		<div>
			<p>
				Today was his birthday. Yami isn&rsquo;t sure how he knows that. He
				can&rsquo;t remember any of his previous birthdays. A green haired woman
				with brilliant green eyes identical to his own comes to mind. She had
				appeared in his mind over and over through the months since waking up
				with a quirk.
			</p>

			<p>
				He even had found a hidden notebook with her face drawn in it, page
				after page. Sometimes broken by the sketch of a boy with spiky hair. He
				just couldn&rsquo;t understand. Who were they? It confused him more when
				he would start crying over their images. Why did seeing them make him so
				sad?
			</p>

			<p>
				Summoning the old sketchbook, he propped it open up against the wall on
				his desk, while also calling forth his quirk notebook. The incident with
				the child happened only a few days ago, and he learned the feeling of
				floating in space was actually from the new quirk.
			</p>

			<p>
				The teen started sketching the child while he collected his thoughts. It
				was a teleportation quirk. If he looked at a destination and called upon
				the quirk, he could blink to teleport to the new location. It seemed
				quite limited in use at first, but maybe there was more to it?
			</p>

			<p>
				A quirk that seems quite weak at first glance can sometimes be
				incredibly strong or impressive in other ways. <em>Attraction</em> was a
				good example, small objects could kill at high speed and with his
				mot&ndash;
			</p>

			<p><em>What?!</em></p>

			<p>
				No! Yami stood up and clutched at his hair in the middle of the room. He
				almost had it. He almost remembered. It was someone important to him,
				they had a weak telekinesis ability. Tears came to his eyes as he cried
				for someone he couldn&rsquo;t even recall properly.
			</p>

			<p>
				Something seemed to whisper in his ear that he shouldn&rsquo;t try so
				hard to remember. That it was okay to move on. Nothing was important in
				the past. He should just forget. Yami allowed the calming murmur to wash
				over his panic. Although, when he finally got up again, he still hung
				onto the sketchbook.
			</p>

			<p>
				He would never let go of this small window into his past. To who he
				might have been before his amnesia problems. Maybe one day he would be
				ready to discover whatever may lie in the shadows of his lost memories
				and ignore whatever instinct insisted that he shouldn&rsquo;t.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br />
		<hr />
		<br />

		<div>
			<p>
				It was a little past midnight, the stroll around abandoned streets
				within Jaku in the crisp night air was refreshing. Yami
				<em>Blinked</em> home to his room outside the laboratory within the
				underground compound below Jaku General Hospital.
			</p>

			<p>
				He had finally found the courage to experiment with the teleportation
				quirk. Like he thought, if he imagined where he wanted to go vividly
				enough, he could teleport there. Although, it did seem to have a range
				limit.
			</p>

			<p>
				Lighting a scented candle, he curled up within a beanbag that was almost
				an exact shade as the tips of his hair. He had cut it back to the usual
				length recently after allowing it to reach past his shoulders. Only a
				few centimeters of green were left on his head.
			</p>

			<p>
				He pulled out a notebook from <em>Pocket</em> and started calmly
				drawing. The news had been holding a press conference about a kidnapped
				student earlier. Something about an attack on one of the UA summer
				camps. He hoped whoever it was would be alright.
			</p>

			<p>
				He hummed a random song to himself as he worked on a sketch of Kurogiri.
				The warper made of mist was so cool looking. Not to mention his quirk!
				His body was almost completely made of a purple mist, except for an area
				around his neck. He could expand the mist into large gateways to connect
				two points in space. It was coordinate based for some reason, but Yami
				had seen weirder limitations. What he didn&rsquo;t know was the
				distance. Could Kurogiri create a warp gate to North America? What about
				to the moon or another planet? If he could open a gate in outer space,
				would things nearby be sucked into the empty abyss? What about
				underwater?
			</p>

			<p>
				Eventually, he was knocked out of his musings by the beep and vibration
				of his pager. Master Garaki had insisted that the ancient technology was
				perfect for transmitting messages within the basement compound under
				Jaku&rsquo;s main hospital. It was a signal dead zone down here, after
				all. His master did have a point though, neither of them ever missed a
				message.
			</p>

			<p>
				&lsquo;All for One has been arrested.&rsquo; &hellip; <em>What?</em>
			</p>
		</div>

		<br />
		<hr />
		<br />

		<div>
			<p>
				The doctor had failed to mention that All for One had injured dozens of
				heroes, some rendered quirkless, a few found dead in the wreckage. A
				walking calamity. The teen had known the power that ancient man, the
				ancient evil, possessed. He had just ignored the sleeping dragon.
			</p>

			<p>
				Images could be found of a body mangled beyond recognition right before
				the Scourge of Kamino passed out from overexertion. Well, beyond
				recognition except for the very recognizable red, white, and blue of his
				tattered costume. The Number One Hero, the Symbol of Peace, All Might,
				was dead.
			</p>

			<p>
				All at the hands of the man he followed alongside his own master. All at
				the power of a quirk that he shared with the Scourge. Yami felt sick. A
				feeling at the edges of his mind insisted that everything was okay, to
				just relax. He refused to fully believe it this time.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br />
		<hr />
		<br />

		<div>
			<p>
				Despite the unease that had rekindled deep in his bones, Yami stayed by
				the Good Doctor&rsquo;s side. Even through the grief and worry that tore
				at the man in the weeks following All for One&rsquo;s capture. Where
				else could the teen go? Like it or not, this was his home, the only
				place that had accepted him that he could remember.
			</p>

			<p>
				The Good Doctor&rsquo;s voice barked out and echoed within the lab,
				&ldquo;Yami, come transfer the regeneration quirk from Subject LS-348b
				to HA-496.&rdquo; Like the dutiful assistant he is, he did as his master
				asked. He had a purpose here, it surely had to be better than leaving
				and being called a waste of space. A quirkless loser, a freak, a
				<em>monster</em>. That&rsquo;s what he was, wasn&rsquo;t it?
			</p>

			<p>
				&ldquo;Transfer this strength quirk to HA-496 as well.&rdquo; As the
				days dragged on, a soreness creeped into every portion of his body. A
				headache had started a few hours ago and kept getting worse, even
				despite the quick rest he had requested. The new quirk caused a burning
				within his arms before forcing it out, into the large noumu. His head
				started to feel like cotton.
			</p>

			<p>
				&ldquo;Ah, let's add that new ice quirk to it too!&rdquo; Yami walked to
				the shelves of those beings that barely held onto life but seemed to
				never die and reached for where the ice quirk was stored. Activating
				<em>All for One</em> once again until a massive spike of pain in his
				head made him stumble over. Blood dripped from his nose as he pushed off
				the ground where he fell. That was new.
			</p>

			<p>
				He ignored it and tried to grab the ice quirk again, only to be met with
				the piercing pain once more. The doctor approached him and hummed to
				himself as Yami clutched at his head. &ldquo;You're falling
				behind&hellip; My greatest creation yet&hellip; Unacceptable. Rest and
				I&rsquo;ll prepare training for you when you wake, Yami.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				Before he could even comprehend what that statement fully meant, a prick
				to his neck was followed by the world fading out.

				Yami awoke with a gasp, scrambling upright in whatever space he had been
				moved to. He had been drugged. His mentor had drugged him,
				<em>again</em>.
			</p>

			<p><em>Wait, again? When was the first time?</em></p>

			<p>
				The headache from before still hadn&rsquo;t left him, and even trying to
				initiate <em>Blink</em> spiked the pain. The space he was in was a cell
				with large gouges in the floor and small splatters of blood. A vague
				sense that there should be white tile instead of concrete and steel.
				Small slits near the top allowed for light to shine through, but were
				too close to the ceiling for Yami to look through.
			</p>

			<p>
				It wasn&rsquo;t long before the metal walls grated against the concrete
				and lifted into the air. A wide open area greeted him that was bathed in
				bright floodlights. A noumu he had recently worked on stood before him,
				already covered in scars.
			</p>

			<p>
				It had been someone with an avian quirk, with long legs, small wings,
				and clawed toes. It was given a speed enhancer, an electrification
				quirk, and minor regeneration that only boosted the healing rate rather
				than true regeneration like other noumu. Built for speed rather than
				strength.
			</p>

			<p>
				The Good Doctor made his presence known from an observation deck a few
				meters up the wall. The space was caged in, so nothing within the space
				below could reach him. &ldquo;Yami, you will learn how to push past your
				limits. This is for your own good. I will not release you myself, you
				must find a way to escape. Pyracmon, knock out Yami, do not kill or
				maim.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>Electricity crackled in the air as his master turned and left.</p>

			<p>Pyracmon was on him in an instant.</p>
		</div>

		<br />

		<div>
			<p>
				The moment the avian creature grabbed him, electric shocks danced across
				his body, dragging him to the floor. Instinct took over as he punched
				the offender away, moving to get back up. Alas, it recovered quicker
				than him. He raised his arm in time to deflect the claws on its feet,
				but not without three large cuts raking across below the elbow of his
				left arm.
			</p>

			<p>
				It screeched an unnatural sound. Jumping back with a flap of its white
				and gray speckled wings before charging at him again, even faster. He
				turned, stupidly, to run away from it this time, but of course, it
				caught him before he could even take three steps. Grabbing his shirt and
				throwing him into the air to add insult to injury.
			</p>

			<p>
				Yami landed with a thud on his side. He really was worthless. The avian
				landed on top of him, digging sharp claws into his hip and right leg as
				its hands reached to strangle him. No thoughts behind its eyes as it did
				so.
			</p>

			<p>
				Fear coursed through his veins at that moment. The noumu did not care if
				he died. The only thing holding it back was the order to not kill him.
				His own order was to escape. Outrunning a creature made for speed was
				not possible, nor was outlasting something that ignored pain and
				exhaustion almost entirely.
			</p>

			<p>
				He needed a moment to think in order to use <em>Blink</em>. He once
				warped without paying full attention and ended up falling into an empty
				tank. Thankfully, Mocha, the doctor&rsquo;s newest pet similar to Johnny
				with a cloning quirk, was the only witness to that event. He would have
				to briefly knock Pyracmon out to have enough time to concentrate with
				this migraine.
			</p>

			<p>
				He grabbed at the avian&rsquo;s wrists before its hands could wrap
				around his throat. Using what small strength he had and rolling to the
				side, he unbalanced it enough to knock it over. He used those few
				seconds to scramble away from it and survey the area. Nothing was
				available to use as a weapon. Not even a loose stone.
			</p>

			<p>
				Screeching, the bird finally made it back to its feet. Eyes slightly
				less foggy in its fury. He had nothing to defend himself with. The only
				thing stored within <em>Pocket</em> were his notebooks, that he would
				rather die over than destroy, and&hellip; and his favorite pencil. The
				one he first used <em>Pocket</em> on months ago. Despite the pain even
				reaching for the quirk caused, he summoned the pencil in a flicker of
				pink light.
			</p>

			<p>
				What the <em>hell</em> could he do with this? He didn&rsquo;t have the
				time to think of a plan before Pyracmon managed to graze another shock
				against his body. Much stronger than before, as muscles locked up for
				barely a second in response. On pure adrenaline, he stabbed the
				noumu&rsquo;s eye in response as he stumbled.
			</p>

			<p>
				Oh, he really pissed it off now&hellip; and he was down the pencil. He
				only had one thing left that could take it down. Cyan and black energy
				began to float around him as <em>All for One</em> activated. It hurt so
				<em>much</em>. The pressure on his mind was excruciating, a warning of
				his limits.
			</p>

			<p>
				He pushed past it all and reached for the avian, his right hand wrapping
				around its arm. Not ideal, the transfer would take longer, but it would
				work. He had only ever moved one or two quirks at once before, the
				creature on him had four. He <em>reached</em>.
			</p>

			<p>
				In a last effort from the avian, electricity surged forward, burning
				Yami&rsquo;s hand, but he did not let go. Whether it was seconds or
				minutes later, the sensation of the quirks falling into place, like
				stars making up a constellation, signaled that he had won. Looking over
				at the beast, the avian noumu seemed to lose what little shine it had in
				its eyes and fell to the side. Like a puppet without its strings.
			</p>

			<p>
				The headache from earlier crescendoed and the surrounding space spun,
				making full thoughts nearly impossible to track. A buzz began in his
				feet, legs, and spine before setting alight with burning pain. It was
				torture. His bones, muscles, and skin buzzed with energy as well. He
				could vaguely recognize that he had curled into a ball on the ground in
				response to the overwhelming full body pain as his consciousness faded.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br />

		<br />

		<div>
			<p>
				When he awoke, he was curled up on his bed. He still felt sick, as
				residual soreness pulsed in time with his heartbeat throughout his body.
				The headache was still present but tempered to a manageable level. The
				room still felt like it was spinning, though. Guess vertigo was part of
				his overuse symptoms, joy.
			</p>

			<p>
				Stretching his legs and then propping himself up, he moved to stand up,
				but promptly fell to the floor. Now fully alert, he looked himself over.
				His legs were completely different since he was last awake. His toes
				were curved like claws, while his heel came up like a second knee. Just
				like the avian noumu&hellip;
			</p>

			<p>
				He reached behind himself, <em>holy shit</em>. Yami had passed out with
				a shirt on, but the wings were small enough to fit under the loose
				fabric. They shifted as his attention turned to his new limbs. The
				sensation of touch from the feathers was so new and strange. He pulled
				his shirt off and tried to command the limb to open. It took some tries
				to move it how he wanted, but he figured it out in the end.
			</p>

			<p>
				He relaxed the limbs and resolved to take a look at himself in the
				mirror, planting his palms on the ground in front of him. Surely this
				was just like walking on tip toes? He just has to remember to not put
				his heel down. He could do this. The teen almost had it when he slipped
				and fell to his side again.
			</p>

			<p>
				He would stand, he couldn&rsquo;t give up. His body may have changed
				without him asking for this, but he would move forward. He always has.
				He had dealt with this scenario before as well.
				<em>Wait, did he ever ask for </em>All for One<em>
					and the changes subjected to him then?</em
				>
				It had also been a choice to use his quirk against the noumu to win.
			</p>

			<p>
				He later stood, leaning with both hands on the counter, in the bathroom,
				staring at his own reflection. Emerald irises stared back with four
				pointed star pupils. White hair tinged with green ends fell slightly in
				his face. Faded freckles still dotted his face despite how little
				sunlight he had in the last year. Scratch marks slightly tinged with
				white sat just above his waist and below his elbow. Around his right
				wrist had a pink fern like marking, likely a minor burn scar from the
				sustained electrical charge at the end of the fight.
			</p>

			<p>
				His spine had a small ridge of white fluffy feathers that gradually
				changed to light gray as the feathers got flatter and longer. Dark gray
				markings covered most of the feathers, leaving a speckled look to the
				wings overall. He actually quite liked the coloring, it matched his
				hair. Small graces. When he managed to stretch out the wings to their
				full length, they hardly came past his fingertips when holding his arm
				out for comparison.
			</p>

			<p>
				He could already tell that the wings were way too small to allow him to
				fly. Maybe he could glide if he was lucky. They should be able to boost
				his jumps at the very least. If he folded them and positioned the curve
				of what might be comparable to the wrist downward, crossing the wingtips
				at his waist, he might be able to fully hide them under his shirts and
				jackets if needed.
			</p>

			<p>
				He made his way back to his bed after that, quickly grabbing a protein
				bar and chugging some water from the nightstand, and curled up to sleep
				the rest of the headache and soreness off. Master Garaki will have to
				make do without him today, he didn&rsquo;t want to see the doctor
				anyway.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br />
		<hr />
		<br />

		<div>
			<p>
				Since that day, dread filled him whenever his master called his name.
				The small insistence that everything was okay wasn&rsquo;t enough for
				him anymore. Master Garaki had been safe, but he <em>wasn&rsquo;t</em>.
				He now remembered a room with white tile that was oh so similar to the
				arena he now found himself in each week.
			</p>

			<p>
				Master Garaki had caught him hoarding a couple knives and a stick like
				weapon, a bo staff, within <em>Pocket</em> after the incident. The
				doctor had seemed excited that he wanted something to defend himself
				with, and sent him back to the arena to <em>train</em>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Yamikumi did <em>not</em> like that arena. Although, it was useful to
				learn where to hit each noumu to stun them or even knock them out with
				the staff. He even accidentally killed one by plunging a knife into its
				brain. Master Garaki had been deeply upset about that and chained him to
				the floor of the arena for a day or two.
			</p>

			<p>
				The staff had the benefit of being a walking aid as well. Although, with
				his new legs, he was <em>fast</em>, even before trying to test the speed
				quirk. He could confidently run around again without tripping too much,
				but some days he just couldn&rsquo;t quite balance properly to walk
				without the stick.
			</p>

			<p>
				He found himself wanting to go back to how things used to be. To a time
				he couldn&rsquo;t quite remember. When a woman with green hair gave him
				occasional hugs that were so warm and safe and nothing like when his
				master had hugged him. When he didn&rsquo;t have a quirk that killed the
				Symbol of Peace. <em>When he had dreamed of being a hero</em>.
			</p>

			<p>
				He had wanted to be a hero? How did he end up here, then? In this cold,
				dark compound where monsters beyond what anyone could dream of were
				created. Where experiments that tore people apart were conducted. Where
				the birth of a new Demon King, All for One&rsquo;s heir, was to
				commence. The villain that killed the Symbol of Peace.
			</p>

			<p>
				Master Garaki&rsquo;s voice reverberated against the walls nearby.
				&ldquo;Yami, come help prepare Adonis.&rdquo; The teen felt compelled to
				comply amidst his inner turmoil. He caught it and wondered something he
				hasn&rsquo;t questioned in a long time,
				<em>was he really that different from a noumu?</em>
			</p>
		</div>

		<br />
		<hr />
		<br />

		<div>
			<p>
				With Shigaraki Tomura occupying all of Master Garaki&rsquo;s time with
				overlooking the Adonis project, Yami found a lot of free time for
				himself. He started going on walks around Jaku during the daytime, even
				finding a high-rise that was perfect to watch the sunrise and sunset
				from.
			</p>

			<p>
				He started to frequent a few places that were kind to give him delicious
				food upon realizing he only had a codename to go by and no money. Likely
				taking pity on him. One shop even offered him a job, but he politely
				declined, trying to explain that he already had duties working as a lab
				assistant.
			</p>

			<p>
				It had crossed his mind more and more frequently to just run away, but
				he was unsure. While the Good Doctor didn&rsquo;t feel safe to him
				anymore, the compound was his home. Something also told him that he
				didn&rsquo;t have any home to go back to within his memories. Beyond
				that, he carried <em>All for One</em>, who would want him? He was likely
				dangerous in the eyes of other people.
			</p>

			<p>
				There was also that nagging feeling that compelled him to listen to
				Master Garaki. If he were to leave, would the doctor hunt him? What
				would happen if he was caught? The chains in the center of an arena and
				blood-stained tile came to mind. A fainter memory of being used for an
				<em>experiment</em> came to mind.
			</p>

			<p>
				He paused from working on making a rail gun within his workshop loft in
				the main lab. <em>An experiment?</em> It&hellip; It kind of made sense,
				and he hated it. His amnesia at the same time as manifesting a quirk he
				got from the doctor was heavily suspicious now that he thought about it.
				A pain spiked in his head, warning him to abandon that thought. He
				refused.
			</p>

			<p>
				At the same time, a large metal clang echoed from deep within the
				compound. A moment later, the roars of dozens of noumu rang in unison.
				People were yelling. The compound was under attack. His
				<em>home</em> was under attack. He abandoned his hobby project and ran
				for the tunnels.
			</p>

			<p>
				Panic slightly clouded his mind. He had to find his master and ensure
				his safety. The first area he checked was the site for Adonis. His
				master was nowhere to be seen except for papers hurriedly strewn across
				the floor and on fire. Noumu shrieked in the distance, and footsteps
				thundered through the halls.
			</p>

			<p>
				Yami turned to run for the closest exit to the hospital above. Likely,
				the same way his master went. He summoned a knife to each hand as he
				finished scrambling up the stairwell. The hospital above was mostly
				abandoned, all the patients and nurses were nowhere to be seen.
			</p>

			<p>
				Only heroes should have the ability to do something like this so
				quickly. He stalled within a hallway as he debated surrendering to the
				heroes. They might be able to protect him, to help him.
				<em>Would they though?</em> After they found out what he could do? What
				he had helped accomplish? He doubted they would be so kind to a monster.
				He ran forward.
			</p>

			<p>
				Master Garaki was shriveled on the floor in front of two heroes when he
				found him. It only took him a moment to recognize the bright blond in
				leather, Present Mic, and the one dressed in all black except for a
				white scarf, Eraserhead. The scarf snaked around the Good Doctor,
				holding him from escape, while the hero used his quirk to disable the
				doctor&rsquo;s own.
			</p>

			<p>
				The old man was the first to sense his presence, pausing from whatever
				tirade he was on to rile up the heroes to address him, &ldquo;Yami, take
				out the heroes! Get us out of here!&rdquo; Present Mic turned to face
				him while Eraserhead continued holding down the ancient man.
			</p>

			<p>
				At the command, the compelling feeling welled up within him once more,
				but he resisted now that he was fully aware of it. Pain spiked in his
				head in response, but he had been dealing with much stronger migraines
				for so long, it meant nothing to him.
			</p>

			<p>
				The pain actually grounded him again as his thoughts from earlier
				returned. It had to be some type of mind control, likely added when he
				was an experiment for a project&hellip; <em>Adonis</em>. How much was he
				forced to forget? How much had his mind been messed with? How much did
				he know about and agree to before all of this?
			</p>

			<p>
				He had wanted to be a hero before everything happened. He knew that.
			</p>

			<p>
				Yami dropped the knives in his hands, trying to show no harm to the
				heroes in front of him, and responded to the doctor, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
				The clatter of steel on white tile only helped signal the finality in
				his refusal to help the Good Doctor anymore.
