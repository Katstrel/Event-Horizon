            <b>Saturday, March 28, 2144</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            A chord had snapped in his mind. A piercing pain yet relief as a
            pressure he hadn&rsquo;t even been aware of lifted. Yami stared down
            at the Good Doctor as he remembered staring up at the tank that
            Shigaraki now floated in over a year ago. He remembered helping
            connect everything together before there was a pain in his neck and
            nothingness after.
        </p>

        <p>
            Fury filled him as his suspicions were confirmed, &ldquo;<em
                >Fuck you.</em
            >&rdquo; Silence hung in the air as not even the two heroes,
            Eraserhead and Present Mic, dared to intervene. Betrayal began to
            trickle into the doctor&rsquo;s expression, but Yami couldn&rsquo;t
            bring himself to feel sorry. The man had deceived him for months,
            made Yami trust him, only to force his loyalty.
        </p>

        <p>
            The silence wasn&rsquo;t cut by anyone speaking up, but rather a
            shift in the air. A sense of foreboding filled the hall as tiny
            cracks webbed through the floor and walls, reaching for the ceiling.
            The smell of dust permeated the air.
        </p>

        <p>The white haired teen&rsquo;s eyes widened, <em>Decay</em>.</p>

        <p>
            The hospital groaned as its foundation flaked away underneath them.
            A thunderous crash shook the hall as another part of the building
            collapsed. Someone might have shouted something, but Yami
            couldn&rsquo;t hear it.
        </p>

        <p>
            The blond hero placed a light hand on his shoulder, grounding him
            once again. &ldquo;C'mon, we need to get out of here.&rdquo; He let
            the man begin to guide him through the halls as Eraserhead dragged
            Garaki behind him. His home was under this hospital. His home was
            being destroyed.
            <em>Shigaraki Tomura</em> was turning his <em>home</em> to
            <em>dust</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
            A chunk of ceiling crashed down behind them. Yami needed to focus.
            The building was coming down around him, and he refused to die
            today. He wanted to see the world, he wanted to <em>remember</em>,
            he wanted to escape this mess.
        </p>

        <p>
            Finally aware of his surroundings once more, he caught the moment
            the building finally gave under them. Without any thinking or
            planning, his body moved on its own. <em>All for One</em> curled
            around the teleportation quirk he named <em>Blink</em>, activating
            it and pushing it to the limits of possibility. Hands with miniature
            black holes in the center reached out for the two heroes as his tiny
            wings propelled him through the air in a somewhat controlled fall.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once he had a hand on each, he teleported with a blink of his eyes.
            The skyline of Jaku greeted them as Yami&rsquo;s vision blacked out.
            His eyes hurt like hell as he pressed his hands to them and groaned.
            He thinks they should be on top of one of his favorite vantage
            points. Jaku General Hospital would be visible in the distance, just
            on the horizon at the base of the mountain.
        </p>

        <p>
            A crash sounded in that direction, likely the hospital finally
            surrendering to gravity without the support of its foundations and
            the compound underneath. Vague shapes started to enter his vision as
            the blindness from overusing <em>Blink</em> slowly cleared.
        </p>

        <p>
            A gruff voice broke the silence afterward, &ldquo;Holy shit.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>&ldquo;Is that the hospital? Shou&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Mic.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;Eraser, we shouldn&rsquo;t be alive right now, holy shit. The
            building collapsed on top of us. I saw it!&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>&ldquo;I know, Mic. I did too.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>
            Silence, then a hesitant, &ldquo;Are you sure we aren&rsquo;t
            dead?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>&ldquo;The kid got us out.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>
            He startled the heroes, as he stood up quickly and leaned against
            the railing of the roof, wanting to see what was left of his home.
            Eyesight still too blurry to see the distance clearly. Despite that,
            he could make out a giant crater that extended deep into the earth
            where Jaku General Hospital and <em>several</em> city blocks
            surrounding it used to be. &ldquo;<em>Oh.</em>&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            His awareness of the two men on the roof with him faded as his
            thoughts slowed. He silently stared at where his home used to be.
            Everything he could easily remember was within that compound and
            surrounding streets. All of it was now dust. The only things he had
            left were his notebooks, the ones always stored within
            <em>Pocket</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;Yami.&rdquo; His name for the past year, the only one he
            knew, grabbed his attention. He looked at the homeless looking hero.
            The man sighed, &ldquo;Can you tell us what happened back there?
            About how you ended up inside the hospital today? We&rsquo;ll help
            you, it's the least we could do after you saved our lives.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            An opportunity, the only one he may ever have, to go with the
            heroes. To trust them. Could he? Would they forgive him for what he
            is? Forgive him for being the prototype to Shigaraki? For willingly
            working with the doctor?
            <em>Was it willingly when he had been tricked?</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            A memory, not fully shaped, but the story was there regardless. He
            was in this situation before. No home, no family or friends or
            allies, nothing to his name. An offer to take him in and he
            accepted. That&rsquo;s how he ended up in the compound, working for
            the Good Doctor.
        </p>

        <p>
            History always repeated unless one learned from past mistakes. He
            wouldn&rsquo;t make that mistake again. He couldn&rsquo;t trust the
            heroes, couldn&rsquo;t trust anyone. Yami looked down at the road
            below and <em>blinked</em>.
        </p>

        <br />
        <hr />

        <p class="patriciapoem" align="center">
            <b>Drawn toward the singularity of your own will</b><br />
            <b>The rules of a former world cease to exist</b><br />
            <b>And the once implausible becomes the inevitable.</b>
        </p>

        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            Yami wasn&rsquo;t sure which city he was in anymore. It didn&rsquo;t
            really matter to him. In the chaos of Jaku, he raided an abandoned
            corner store for food and water before setting off. After the first
            night of sleeping on a roof, he learned to grab a blanket, or a few,
            from another store the next day.
        </p>

        <p>
            It was currently the night, constellations shown brightly overhead.
            Legends say that long before the dawn of quirks, people had used the
            stars to navigate the world. Each grouping of stars had their own
            name. One was Ursa Minor, the Little Bear, Arcas. While the tale of
            Arcas was not well known, even before quirks appeared, the tail of
            the Little Bear was very famous.
        </p>

        <p>Polaris, the North Star.</p>

        <p>
            The teen started to follow it, wishing for guidance in the chaos
            surrounding him. When the sun started to rise, he retreated to a
            hill and summoned a sketchbook in a flicker of pink light.
            Today&rsquo;s sketch would be of the sunrise just beginning to peak
            over the horizon. A new day. A new beginning.
        </p>

        <p>
            Stardust came to mind. The death of a star is terrifying, a
            brilliant explosion destroying everything within range, but the
            leftover clouds of dust will give new life to newer stars and
            planets and other celestial bodies. This was just a new beginning
            for him, and it could be beautiful if he wanted it to be. Nebulas
            were quite alluring.
        </p>

        <p>
            Last time he lost everything, he became Yami. He wasn&rsquo;t the
            doctor&rsquo;s assistant anymore, he wasn&rsquo;t Yami anymore. The
            teen may not remember his own name <em>yet</em>, but Mikumo would do
            for now. Mikumo was <em>his</em>. He didn&rsquo;t belong to anyone,
            he didn&rsquo;t need anyone, and his name was one he chose rather
            than given.
        </p>

        <p>
            Mikumo stared up at the retreating twilight. Watching the previous
            darkness fade away.

                Tartarus Maximum Security Prison. Where the Scourge of Kamino
                was being held after his capture in August. Together, they

        <p>
            Mirio sat on a bench with Torino Sorahiko, an old pro hero that had
            trained All Might and knew about the secret of <em>One for All</em>,
            standing in front of him. Even with all his training, he failed to
            take Shigaraki down when it mattered most. The villain had kept
            pursing him, forcing him to use <em>Permeation</em> over and over,
            struggling to breathe between evasions of the man&rsquo;s hands.
        </p>

        <p>
            He was eventually forced to retreat. To choose to live another day
            and continue the fight later when he gathered more strength, when he
            mastered more of this ancient quirk. &ldquo;I know that look, stop
            mopping. You did the best you could with what you had.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>&ldquo;But-&rdquo;</p>

        <p>
            Torino kicked him mildly in the shin. &ldquo;No buts! Focus on how
            you can do better in the future rather than what you should have
            done in the past. Carry too much guilt and you&rsquo;ll break,
            kid.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            The blond understood, <em>he did</em>. &ldquo;Just- argh, All for
            One is free again, and I couldn&rsquo;t even defeat Shigaraki. Was I
            really the best choice?&rdquo; He was staring to doubt he could live
            up to the legacy he now carried.
        </p>

        <p>
            The man gave him a serious look, &ldquo;No one is the best choice,
            kid. To my understanding, Nana and Toshinori were different from the
            rest of the holders by choosing their successor long before their
            deaths. We&rsquo;re just a long line of unlucky people trying our
            best to defeat a demon.&rdquo; Mirio stayed quiet at that.
        </p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;Now, what are you going to do about it? Throw in the towel
            and hand this off to someone else, or rise up to face All for One or
            die trying like the rest?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            Mirio stood up, fire reignited in his blue eyes, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
            go another round.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            Green eyes looked up at the towering gates of U.A. High School, the
            best hero school in the country. No one passed him by. Today was a
            day like any other. A chilly breeze ruffled his fully white curls.
            He remembered a boy with red eyes and sandy colored hair that came
            up in untamable spikes.
        </p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;<em
                >Let&rsquo;s be heroes! Together, Kacchan! The best hero duo
                ever!&rdquo;</em
            >
        </p>

        <p>
            He remembered being very young. Before he learned he was quirkless,
            before Kacchan started insisting that he was too weak to be a hero.
            Too weak to keep up with him anymore. He had tried to prove him
            wrong, following his best friend&rsquo;s footsteps everywhere he
            went.
        </p>

        <p>
            He remembered a tree trunk suspended over a small creek. Kacchan had
            slipped off, then rejected his help when he was the only one to jump
            down after him. Too weak for Kacchan to even accept his aid. He
            didn&rsquo;t give up on following the explosive boy, though.
        </p>

        <p>
            Kacchan was the only one to make it in. They had wanted to be heroes
            together. Mikumo wasn&rsquo;t a hero. Despite the longing in his
            chest to follow the other boy once more, Mikumo took one last deep
            breath before he turned away from the UA barrier. Walking into the
            mostly abandoned streets of Musutafu below.
        </p>

        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            Katsuki couldn&rsquo;t sit still. After the prison break, UA had
            constructed a barrier that blocked out the horizon. Principal Nedzu
            had more apartments built on campus and invited their families and
            the public to take shelter within the walls of the school grounds.
            He couldn&rsquo;t shake the feeling that this was all his fucking
            fault.
        </p>

        <p>
            If he hadn&rsquo;t been kidnapped during the summer camp, the Kamino
            Raid wouldn&rsquo;t have had to happen and All Might would still be
            alive. If the hero had lived, if the Scourge hadn&rsquo;t been kept
            in Tartarus, none of what was happening right now would be
            happening.
            <strike
                ><em
                    >If he hadn&rsquo;t been so hard on Izuku, would he still be
                    by his side?</em
                ></strike
            >
            He gritted his teeth. <em>Damn it</em>. It was not the time to be
            feeling sorry for himself about what happened with the shitty nerd.
        </p>

        <p>
            Shortly after Auntie Inko&rsquo;s death and Izuku&rsquo;s
            disappearance, his mother scheduled him for therapy. Claiming that
            they both needed it. At first, he had resisted, he didn&rsquo;t need
            to talk to anyone about his fucking <em>feelings</em>. He eventually
            gave in. Andou was a man who didn't give or take bullshit.
        </p>

        <p>
            The hobo his class had as a homeroom teacher within UA finally made
            his entrance, knocking Katsuki from any more thoughts.
            &ldquo;Alright, students. This is confidential information, but
            Nedzu has agreed for me to let you all onto a live case for your
            information gathering unit. I will be the bridge between your class
            and the rest of the team on the case. You will not leave school
            grounds to gather information, but you will have access to nearly
            all sources UA has access to in order to hunt down the target.
            Understood?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            A murmur of agreement, they knew how to keep their mouths shut. They
            were fucking second years, even if slightly unofficially.
        </p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;Alright, then let&rsquo;s begin. Our target is Yami. First
            sighted during the Jaku Hospital Raid. Most of you participated at
            other locations, so a quick overview of events is in order. Upon
            beginning the raid, noumu appeared and attacked from all sides. The
            main strike team charged ahead in hopes of capturing the main
            target, Garaki Kyuudai, before he escaped.
        </p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;The evacuation team worked to get all the patients and nurses
            out of the building or into custody for further questioning. Once
            the building was clear, Mic and I found Garaki trying to flee
            unnoticed. At the same time, the strike team found where Shigaraki
            Tomura was being kept while fighting several high end noumus.
        </p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;Yami was spotted running from the chamber Shigaraki was in
            and then ran into us with Garaki. Garaki ordered Yami to attack us,
            but it refused to do so. This tells us that Yami is able to act
            independently, being able to think fully for itself.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            Fucking Raccoon Eyes couldn&rsquo;t keep quiet, interrupting the
            hobo, &ldquo;Wait, sensei, why did you refer to them as an
            it?&rdquo;
        </p>

            The man sighed, &ldquo;Because, after saving us from the building
            collapse as Shigaraki woke up, Yami was picked up by a store camera
            using multiple quirks. Besides Shigaraki and the Scourge of Kamino,
            only noumu have multiple quirks.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            The hologram board flickered to life at the front of the classroom.
            &ldquo;This,&rdquo; Long legs, that bent in two places, held the
            noumu up as claws tried to dig into the concrete tile below it.
            Gray, white, and black feathers covered the creature&rsquo;s back.
            Fluffy white hair sat atop a pale face with faded freckles. Green
            eyes that were too familiar for Katsuki&rsquo;s comfort stared to
            the left of the camera. &ldquo;Is our target.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <br />

            The similarity between Yami and Izuku unnerved Katsuki. It had been
            two years since he disappeared. Two years since Auntie Inko died
            suddenly from a respiratory infection. His mother had gone to look
            for Izuku a few weeks later after she had grieved the death of her
            best friend, only to find an empty apartment.
        </p>

        <p>
            The rent hadn&rsquo;t been paid, and the landlord explained that he
            didn&rsquo;t know the situation. He didn&rsquo;t even know if Izuku
            had still been living there. Alone. Katsuki and his mother had been
            allowed to look through the place before it was cleaned out to rent
            again. His only hope that Izuku was still out there,
            <strike><em>and not dead on a sidewalk</em></strike
            >, was his missing notebooks.
        </p>

        <p>
            The last thing he had said to him was to take a swan dive and pray
            for a quirk. Guilt had eaten at him for months. Oh, the morbid irony
            if Yami was Izuku. He didn&rsquo;t want to believe it. The
            similarity meant nothing. Izuku had to be okay somewhere. He was
            always smart, even if Katsuki hated him at the time for being better
            than him.
        </p>

        <p>
            The hobo stood nearby, on the lookout. It had taken a lot to
            convince the man to allow them to leave the gates of UA to simply
            visit a grave. He hasn&rsquo;t since the dorms were established. He
            didn&rsquo;t want to explain to any extras why this was so important
            to him.
        </p>

        <p>
            The teen stopped in front of a grave he knew by heart by now, the
            name
            <em>Midoriya Inko</em> written in beautiful kanji across it. He
            wasn&rsquo;t sure why he came out to it today. He still kneeled and
            allowed his thoughts tumble out, similar to how the nerd would
            think. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Auntie. I- I might have seen Izuku. I
            hope it isn&rsquo;t him. We should have been there for him sooner. I
            should have been there.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            He paused as he started quietly crying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
            sorry.&rdquo; After several long minutes, a strong hand rested on
            his shoulder. It was time to head back to UA.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>
            The white haired teen eventually came across Takoba Beach, it was
            covered in trash and scrap. Mountains of refuse blocked what surely
            must be a pretty sunset behind it. He took the time to scramble
            across all of it to find a hidden, rickety dock on the other side.
            Waves crashed loudly against the dirty beach.
        </p>

        <p>
            He sat on the dock and enjoyed what little of the sunset was left.
            The stars beginning to twinkle in the twilight above. The night sky
            was brighter now that the city behind him had dimmed, people running
            to strongholds like UA in the wake of the prison break.
        </p>

        <p>
            Pulling out a newer sketchbook, he began to draw the imitation of a
            black hole. Galaxies spun around supermassive black holes. Countless
            stars entrapped by the gravity of the monster that takes and takes.
            At the center, gravity becomes infinite. The singularity. The
            unreachable end, forever falling if one fell in.
        </p>

        <p>
            Forever getting stronger with no end in sight. Quirks. Each quirk
            was unique, encoded by a randomized strand of DNA. Uncountable
            possibilities, not all of them viable. Each with their own weight,
            feeling, power. He would know. There was an entire universe to
            explore, and no one could see it all.
        </p>

        <p>
            Mikumo fell asleep under the stars, to the sound of crashing waves.
            Thinking of cleaning the beach to its former glory. Making this his
            new home.

            He watched the screen intently, claws digging into the floor from
            the amount of tension held in his body. He so badly hoped the heroes
            won. Mikumo was holed up in his current home, an abandoned camper
            van hidden within Takoba Beach on the shore of Musutafu.
        </p>

        <p>
            He had a small television propped against the wall with a few blocks
            of wood. Blue static flickered in the air around the room as he
            charged the battery that powered his home with <em>Taser</em>. He
            should probably rename that quirk, but it was kind of funny.
        </p>

        <p>
            A hero named Lemillion had shown up to the battlefield and was
            successfully stalling All for One by playing a high stakes game of
            whack-a-mole. The hero seemed to have a quirk that allowed him to
            become intangible and provided super strength. A dual quirk. Very
            uncommon.
        </p>

        <p>
            Though, what surprised Mikumo the most was All for One himself. Gold
            energy floated around him as each injury he received
            <em>rewound</em>. That was <em>not</em> regeneration. The man even
            had a face! Gone was the scar tissue, replaced with white hair and
            eyes shaped like his own. Makes sense, seeing as those are the
            features that changed within his own appearance when he received
            <em>All for One</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Later on, forest green eyes would watch along with the rest of the
            world as All for One reached Shigaraki. The man had been rewound
            into a child at that point, but he did it. Shigaraki briefly
            resisted before a black and red light encompassed both of the
            <em>All for One</em> users and All for One dropped out of the sky.
        </p>

        <p>
            Shigaraki&rsquo;s eyes turned white, and the man smiled with all
            teeth. Horror gripped Mikumo as he realized that Shigaraki was no
            longer Shigaraki, <em>that</em> was All for One. While he hated
            Shigaraki for what he had done, for destroying his last home, no one
            deserved to have their mind taken over by someone else.
        </p>

        <p>
            With a younger body modified to be unnaturally strong and over a
            century of experience, the heroes never stood a chance against the
            Demon King.
        </p>

        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            Mikumo sat on the edge of a rooftop within Musutafu. Below him was
            an apartment complex he finally remembers. He grew up here,
            Kacchan&rsquo;s house used to be nearby. Down the street was a park
            they would play at, and the creek they would sneak into was in the
            other direction. He drew the building in front of him, the one that
            housed his first home.
        </p>

        <p>
            He remembered and drew his room, a veritable shrine to All Might.
            His bed next to the window, the desk against the opposite wall, a
            bookshelf in the corner that used to hold his precious notebooks.
            Shelves upon shelves of figurines of different heroes he had looked
            up to. A collector's card of All Might he had gotten with Kacchan,
            one he had lost within Jaku.
        </p>

        <p>
            Movement below him made him pause. Three young adults wandered and
            quietly talked, just barely audible to him in the silence of the
            abandoned city. Mikumo recognized one of them, his blue eyes were
            dulled with slightly matted blond hair. Lemillion, the hero who
            could stall All for One.
        </p>

        <p>
            Intrigued, Mikumo dismissed the notebook he was drawing in and
            silently got up to follow them. Alas, he accidentally hit a loose
            stone, sending it careening down the side of the building where it
            loudly hit the pavement below. The trio looked up, locking eyes with
            him briefly, before he <em>blinked</em> in panic.
        </p>

        <p>
            He wasn&rsquo;t ready to be found by anyone. He wasn&rsquo;t ready
            to interact with other people again. Now people knew he lived here,
            he had to leave. Musutafu was becoming more and more dangerous to
            live in as noumu and villains moved in, anyway.
        </p>

        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            The scenery was the best part about living in the wild. Mikumo
            frequently traveled with the moon and stars as his companions.
            Slowly carving out his own constellations to navigate by. His
            previously faded freckles shown brightly in his reflections. He
            passed through uncountable cities, drew their skylines, and crossed
            upon other nomads he found the courage to talk and trade with.
        </p>

        <p>
            The only risk were the noumu and sometimes rogue villain which he
            had plenty of experience fighting against thanks to the mad doctor.
            Many of his knives were stained with blood after the past several
            weeks wandering the countryside. His staff was slightly splintered
            in a few places. Mikumo considered trying to create a new staff or
            look for one in the next dojo he came across.
        </p>

        <p>
            Mikumo reached the top of the mountain he was climbing and waited
            for the sun to chase the darkness of night away. The outlines of
            rolling valleys below were dimly illuminated by the moon. Later he
            sketched vines that overgrew buildings left behind by the followers
            of All for One and the underground society he had heard of from the
            nomads.
        </p>

        <p>
            Maybe one day he would approach them, a loneliness hung to him and
            dragged him down most days lately. He could remember almost
            everything from before he had accepted the doctor&rsquo;s
            invitation. He was always lonely, and he should be used to the
            feeling, but the emptiness of abandoned cities still weighed heavily
            upon him. The silence sometimes oppressive rather than comforting
            like it used to be.
        </p>

        <p>
            It was harder and harder to feel like he wasn&rsquo;t a monster as
            <em>All for One</em> roiled in his blood, demanding to be used. His
            hands had started itching in the last few days. It had been months
            since he used the transfer aspect of his quirk. He had no reason to
            after the destruction of the laboratory, and he found himself scared
            to after the Fall of Heroes.
        </p>

        <p>
            He didn&rsquo;t want to acknowledge the quirk that he shared with
            that demon. Didn&rsquo;t want to use the same quirk that had killed
            his idol, All Might. Using the quirks he collected was
            <em>different</em>. It wasn&rsquo;t exactly <em>that</em> quirk.
            Although, how funny, he used to be quirkless, dreaming for a quirk.
            Now, he was scared to use the one he was given.
        </p>

        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            It was late. The full moon hung brightly in the sky behind him. Ever
            since the collapse of Japan, light pollution had dwindled. Power
            grids unable to be maintained by those wandering outside the control
            of All for One. It wouldn&rsquo;t be worth it anyway. The noumu
            seemed to be attracted to man made light at night. It left the
            galaxy of stars visible in the darkness of night all over Japan.
        </p>

        <p>
            The underground hero, he doesn&rsquo;t care that heroes don't
            formally exist anymore, leaned against the building the rest of his
            group was in. Shouta had first watch since, in the words of Hizashi,
            he was nocturnal. The blond wasn&rsquo;t <em>wrong</em>, but the man
            had forcefully volunteered Shouta&rsquo;s sleep. He would have his
            revenge.
        </p>

        <p>
            The wind rustled the grass poking through cracks in the concrete
            sidewalks and street. The sound soothing the man&rsquo;s ears.
            That&rsquo;s when he heard something scrabbling against stone. Now
            on high alert, he saw when a figure illuminated by the moonlight
            glided on tiny wings from one roof to another. Their white hair
            seemed to glisten in the pale light.
        </p>

        <p>
            Their eyes briefly caught, stunning jade filled with recognition met
            black hidden in the shadows. Yami looked more wild since he last saw
            the boy, clothes clearly well-worn and even torn in a few places.
            Bandages wrapped around one ankle and both lower arms.
        </p>

        <p>
            The boy that had saved his life opened his mouth and called out
            softly in an overly joyful and singsong tone, &ldquo;Hi, thanks for
            checking in. I'm still a piece of garbage.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p><em>What?</em></p>

        <p>
            The moment only lasted a few seconds before the teen closed his
            eyes, shadows flickering in Shouta&rsquo;s peripheral vision, and
            Yami was gone once again. Not even a whisper in the wind.
        </p>

        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            Mikumo had watched Eraserhead from a distance for a few days after
            that. He had panicked and said the first meme that came to mind to
            confuse the old pro. Surprisingly, it worked, since the man
            didn&rsquo;t erase his quirks. Present Mic had come out to guard the
            door instead as the night rolled closer to morning. The white haired
            teen was quite happy to see both of them were okay.
        </p>

        <p>
            The entire group turned out to consist of Eraserhead, Present Mic, a
            girl with pink skin and hair with small yellow antlers on her head,
            a boy with red hair and a hardening quirk, and <em>Kacchan</em>.
            Longing to just say something to the other teen came back full
            force. Would he even recognize Mikumo? The fear and anxiety was
            still too much for him to advance.
        </p>

        <p>
            Although, despite being careful to stay out of their lines of sight,
            on the fourth day the girl saw him and cheerily called out,
            &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; The rest turned, not really surprised to see
            him. They had known he was tailing them.
        </p>

        <p>
            He almost <em>blinked</em>, but he found that he actually did want
            to talk to them. Being alone ate at him more and more, especially
            when he had watched them all hang off each other and laugh despite
            the bleak, silent atmosphere. &ldquo;Uh&hellip; hi?&rdquo; he
            nervously responded.
        </p>

        <p>
            His hesitancy seemed to only make the girl smile more warmly,
            &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Ashido Mina. What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;Mikumo.&rdquo; He watched in his peripheral vision as Kacchan
            seemed to give him some type of look at that.
        </p>

        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            Katsuki stared at the noumu, Yami. That had to be Izuku. The
            similarities were uncanny and screamed at the back of his mind. He
            responded to Raccoon Eyes&rsquo; question with a meek,
            &ldquo;Mikumo&rdquo; Katsuki couldn&rsquo;t help but stare at him
            critically.
        </p>

        <p>
            Shitty Hair decided to introduce himself next with a shitty smile,
            &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Kirishima Eijirou.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            The white haired teen had quickly glanced at him before looking
            away, seeming to want to ignore him&hellip; He clearly remembered
            <em>something</em> about Katsuki, did he know his own name? Well,
            one way to find out, &ldquo;Oi, Mikumo was it?&rdquo; The bastard
            finally turned to look at Katsuki, although he seemed very
            uncomfortable as he fidgeted with his hands. Just like the nerd
            would have done. &ldquo;What does the name Midoriya Izuku mean to
            you?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            He watched as the other teen&rsquo;s eyes widened. Widened in what
            seemed to be recognition. That bastard remembered and thought he
            could fucking hide from Katsuki after <em>almost three years</em>.
            Fat chance. Although, his own confusion surfaced as the teen&rsquo;s
            small wings flared and hands clutched at his head. Energy crackled
            in the air and Katsuki remembered that even if this creature was
            originally Izuku, <em>and oh fuck, it was</em>, this was a
            <em>noumu</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Aizawa stepped forward, likely about to activate <em>Erasure</em> on
            the stressed creature before them in case it attacked. Thankfully,
            before that could happen, shadows danced at the edges of
            Katsuki&rsquo;s vision as Izuku, Yami, Mikumo, whatever his fucking
            name was, disappeared.
        </p>

        <p>
            Damn his impulsiveness, he should have been more careful approaching
            what was left of Izuku.
        </p>

        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            He thought he knew everything, <em>he didn&rsquo;t</em>. He clutched
            at his head as he truly remembered <em>everything</em>. His mother
            apologizing to him for his quirklessness. The teacher calling out
            his desire to go to UA for the class to make fun of him. All Might
            smiling after he told him he couldn&rsquo;t be a hero.
        </p>

        <p>
            So much that he didn't even realize he was missing fell into place
            as if he never lost his memories. As if he hadn&rsquo;t been someone
            else for over a year. Memories of the Good Doctor treating him so
            nicely after trapping him in a white tile room for days.
            <em>Conditioning</em>. The man had always planned on using him as a
            fucked up experiment, hadn&rsquo;t he?
        </p>

        <p>
            He remembered all the small smiles his mother gave him that he had
            forgotten. He remembered as the sunset bathed her in a golden light
            on a hospital bed. Kacchan almost destroying
            <em>Hero Analysis for the Future #13</em>. Almost dying hours later
            in disgusting sludge within an underpass tunnel.
        </p>

        <p>
            Bright smiles as he and his mother went to HeroCon for his birthday
            one year. He had left the photo on a shrine in his room at Jaku. The
            shrine that was <em>missing</em> when he woke up with a different
            name. There should be a grave in Musutafu, he never visited it.
        </p>

        <p>
            The final loose strings that had a hold over his mind fell away as
            he whispered, &ldquo;Midoriya Izuku&rdquo; to the empty alleyway
            surrounding him. That used to be his name. The boy who wanted to be
            a hero, the boy who had his dreams shattered by All Might. Yami had
            been born shortly after when the Good Doctor reached out to him.
        </p>

        <p>
            He couldn&rsquo;t be a hero like Izuku wanted, he refused to be a
            villain like Yami ended up becoming. He was Izuku, he was Yami, but
            he couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to use one of those names.
        </p>

        <p>Mikumo was the one to remember it all.</p>

        <p>Formed by a sea of stardust made of broken dreams and homes.</p>

        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            Mirio woke up from another strange dream. A memory that didn&rsquo;t
            belong to him. A feeling of hot strings coiled around his bones.
            Suffocating and comforting at the same time. A new quirk from the
            past holders. <em>Blackwhip,</em> they had called it. Able to be
            controlled by harnessing his anger, easily uncontrollable if his
            anger controlled him.
        </p>

        <p>
            This wasn&rsquo;t the first time he awoke with another quirk and
            more memories than he bargained for. <em>Float</em>,
            <em>Danger Sense</em>, and <em>Smokescreen</em> were already at his
            beck and call. He couldn&rsquo;t train with them easily without the
            possibility of All for One learning about his growing strength, but
            he was making do with passing trips to Nedzu&rsquo;s underground
            network.
        </p>

        <p>
            Mirio was biding his time for the singularity, for when he could
            control all the quirks harbored within <em>One for All</em>. All for
            One wouldn&rsquo;t know what hit him when he was ready to face the
            ancient evil.
        </p>

        <p>
            A woman with periwinkle hair poked her head into the room he was
            laying in, breaking his thoughts. &ldquo;Hey, Mirio, we made
            breakfast! Tamaki managed to find some eggs, so I made scrambled
            eggs for us.&rdquo; He smiled brightly at his friends, grateful they
            had insisted on staying with him despite the danger.
        </p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;Thanks, Nejire! We should head out when we&rsquo;re done. I
            want to find a mouse hole later to test a new toy.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            She practically ran into the room and jumped on him, shaking him as
            she excitedly asked, &ldquo;Oooo, what is it this time? Tell
            me!&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            Mirio cracked a smile, already having the perfect codename in mind
            for the new quirk, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s silly string.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            Mikumo sat on a rickety old pier. The stars shone brightly overhead,
            while waves crashed loudly against the partially clean beach. The
            teen leaned back as the universe reflected in his star shaped eyes.
            His white hair and wings set ablaze by the pale moonlight overhead.
            Claws lightly taped against the rotting wood in time with a beat
            only he could hear.
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>All for One</em> itched in his palms and roiled in his bones. He
            ignored its demands to discover new quirks. It longed to pull new
            stars into its orbit, creating new constellations within the void of
            his dreamscape. The few he had were enough for him and danced
            beautifully around <em>All for One</em>, twisting into a rainbow of
            color along the event horizon.
            <em>Pocket. Blink. Taser. Nyoom.</em> His named quirks, along with
            an avian mutation and minor boosted healing rate.
        </p>

        <p>
            After his brief run in with Kacchan and learning his old name, he
            returned to Musutafu, to Takoba Beach. He had spent a few days
            looking for the graveyard that held the headstone for Midoriya Inko,
            leaving flowers he picked himself and cleaning it once he had.
        </p>

        <p>
            In less than a single afternoon, his old camper van was in working
            order again. <em>Taser</em> had quickly recharged the old battery he
            had left behind. That was a week or two ago now, and the chill of
            fall was beginning to set in. Ideally, Mikumo wanted to stay on the
            beach for the winter and finish cleaning it while he was in the city
            again.
        </p>

        <p>
            He thought of rebuilding the pier, breathing new life onto the
            shoreline that was his home. A bench to sit upon as he stared into
            the abyss. Strings of fairy lights to dimly light pathways though
            the sand at night.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the spring, he could plant a variety of flowers surrounding the
            grave. His mother deserved every beautiful flower he could find. She
            may not have been perfect, may not have been there for him, may have
            left too soon, but he loved her anyway.
        </p>

        <p>
            The constellation of Aries caught his eye. The sign of change and
            growth. It was quite fitting.
        </p>

        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            His progress on the beach was going smoothly after returning to
            Musutafu several months ago. Only a small portion of the shore was
            covered in trash. Some of it was repurposed into small decorations,
            like a tree made of wire with leaves of plastic and glass in all
            colors, that sat close to his camper. He had even found a bucket of
            dull blue paint and covered the outside in the color, leaving
            looping spirals of the original white behind.
        </p>

        <p>
            Planters that he found or made littered the surrounding area with
            flowers, small trees, fruits, and vegetables. His sunflowers had
            opened their blossoms a few weeks ago around marigolds that looked
            like the sunset and pink cosmos reaching for the sky. Mikumo had
            also planted a large collection of flowers around his mother&rsquo;s
            grave, sometimes taking ones from his beach to lay at her headstone.
        </p>

        <p>
            The coastal wind picked up and ruffled the feathers on his back. He
            stood on a deck that he had built over the camper as another roof to
            protect it and offer a vantage point. Stretching his wings, he
            leaped into the wind. It was never enough to truly fly, but those
            moments gliding in the air always felt so freeing.
        </p>

        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            Mikumo glided down to the roof a story below him. Ever since
            returning to Musutafu he had carved a section of the city as his
            territory. Most noumu now knew that entering it meant death and
            stayed away. Villains didn't fare much better, making his area the
            safest in the city.
        </p>

        <p>
            A few wanderers had taken up home within the perimeter and had their
            own small, thriving community. He had thought to approach them once,
            but the fear in their eyes had made him turn around instead and
            leave some fruit and seeds nearby for them later. They probably knew
            he wasn&rsquo;t natural. It wasn&rsquo;t like he hid his multiple
            quirks.
        </p>

        <p>
            On one occasion after that, he heard them call him The Tengu. He
            couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh at how well it fit once he returned
            home. A bird-like yokai, a demon,
            <strike><em>if only they knew</em></strike
            >. One that had protected forests and mountains, as he now protects
            this portion of the abandoned and war torn city.
        </p>

        <p>
            Coming back to the present, a noumu was sniffing along his streets
            as it lumbered along on three limbs. It was hunting. While he could
            kill it now and save who or what the beast had its sights on, he was
            curious as to where it was trying to go. It was a good opportunity
            to practice his stealth more anyway.
        </p>

        <p>
            The noumu stopped suddenly a few blocks later as it stood to its
            feet and <em>ran</em>. A young scream sounded from the dead end
            alleyway it was headed towards.
            <em>Not on Mikumo&rsquo;s watch</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>Blinking</em>, he appeared in front of the humanoid creature
            while a knife flickered into his right hand with a pink light. It
            only gave pause for a second before roaring, Mikumo gave in yelled
            back at it even though it wouldn&rsquo;t understand, &ldquo;You
            really want to go? I&rsquo;ll <em>fucking</em> go big guy.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            So predictable, it swung a large fist at him, did it even have any
            offensive abilities besides that speed? He dodged and grabbed the
            arm, using the momentum to pull the noumu to the floor. It roared
            once again before Mikumo plunged his knife deep into the exposed
            brain, aiming for the brain stem, where he knew it would kill it.
        </p>

        <p>
            He turned to address whoever was in the alley. A child with black
            hair and deep blue eyes stared at him, slightly hidden behind an old
            dumpster. He couldn&rsquo;t have been older than eight. Children
            shouldn&rsquo;t be out in the wild. Any that were out in this mess,
            would have been within a group. &ldquo;Hey, where are you supposed
            to be? Do your guardians know you&rsquo;re out here?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            The boy simply stared at him. Right, he was now slightly covered in
            blood, and took out the creature that was chasing him in less than
            ten seconds. Most of the others in the city would have struggled for
            a minute to take any noumu down. He sighed and took a step forward,
            only to pause as the boy asked, &ldquo;Why did you do that?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Why did you throw yourself in front of it?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>Still deeply confused, he stammered, &ldquo;T-to help you?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know me. Why did you do it?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;Uh, I guess I couldn&rsquo;t let it hurt someone else?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;What if it hurt you instead, you don&rsquo;t know me.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;I would have been fine? It&rsquo;s fine. I just like helping
            others. Saving others always feels right to me.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;Heroes are the ones that are usually killed first. Throwing
            their lives away for people they don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Damn,
            okay.
        </p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;I&rsquo;m far from being a hero, kid. I would have killed
            that noumu today anyway, whether you were here or not.&rdquo;
            Kouta&rsquo;s stomach growled, the perfect topic change.
            &ldquo;Hungry? I can take you back to my place or to the nearest
            base with other people.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>Kouta was quiet for a moment before, &ldquo;Your place?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>
            Surprised, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t live here?&rdquo; He had been
            expecting the kid to want to go back home. Or maybe they were trying
            to run away?
        </p>

        <p>&ldquo;... No.&rdquo; Hmm.</p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;Well, welcome to my corner of Musutafu then. The locals call
            me The Tengu.&rdquo; No recognition at the name, the kid truly
            wasn&rsquo;t from the area. &ldquo;Although, please call me Mikumo.
            What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>&ldquo;Kouta.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>
            A few minutes later and Mikumo was running through the streets of
            Musutafu with the soft glow of <em>Nyoom</em> following in his
            footsteps. Kouta hung onto his shoulders, while the teen supported
            his legs with his arms. &ldquo;I thought your quirk was
            teleportation.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;Ah, not quite. I have multiple quirks. One is teleportation,
            while another is speed, and so on.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>&ldquo;Whoa.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>
            Mikumo cracked a wide smile as an idea formed in his mind,
            &ldquo;Want to do something cool?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>&ldquo;Cooler than this?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Yeah, you&rsquo;ll have to hang on tight, though!&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo;</p>

        <p>
            Mikumo hopped along a path he knew well that didn&rsquo;t require
            his arms to climb. Quickly reaching the top of a building only three
            stories tall. Before them stretched Takoba Beach as the afternoon
            sun glistened on the water into the horizon. &ldquo;Wow!&rdquo;
            Mikumo continued his momentum across the rooftop, &ldquo;Wait!
            Stop!&rdquo;, and leaped into the air, small wings snapping open to
            catch the sea breeze.
        </p>

        <p>
            As his claws hit the warm sand, a laugh bubbled up from the kid on
            his back, &ldquo;Mikumo, that was so cool! Do it again!&rdquo; The
            teen couldn&rsquo;t help but smile along with Kouta&rsquo;s joy. He
            did that. He truly brightened someone&rsquo;s day for the first time
            in a
            <em>long</em> time. For a moment, he could completely ignore the
            itch in his palms.
        </p>

        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            Mirio couldn&rsquo;t stop blaming himself. The loss still too fresh.
            It had been a simple outing, the area was supposed to have been
            clear. It wasn&rsquo;t. He had helped Bakugou and Kirishima take
            Kouta out for fresh air outside the underground network. Kouta had
            been so excited to see the sun and fall leaves, despite the slight
            chill in the air. Aizawa and Shinsou were supposed to bring Eri up
            to join them a few hours later. That&rsquo;s when it happened.
        </p>

        <p>
            A pack of lower tier noumu converged on them, mainly targeting Mirio
            and then Bakugou once the monsters realized how strong the sandy
            blond was as well. Kirishima was the only one left to guard Kouta.
            The red head claimed that he secured Kouta before coming back to
            help him and Bakugou with the horde. They couldn&rsquo;t find the
            kid once they had won.
        </p>

        <p>
            Days spent searching the area for clues, any sign or remains of him.
            Nothing. Bakugou and Kirishima had to return to Nedzu&rsquo;s
            current main camp to move bases again. Mirio couldn&rsquo;t stay in
            one location for too long. No one wanted to give up searching for
            Kouta, but everyone had more pressing priorities. They had to leave
            him behind.
        </p>

        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />

        <p>
            The eighteen-year-old stood on the balcony above his home. The sea
            breeze ruffled his white hair and feathers. Sakura trees bloomed in
            the distance as loose petals danced in the air. This was peace.
        </p>

        <p>
            The winter had come and gone, Kouta was still living with Mikumo. He
            had admitted to not knowing which way he came from, and even then
            his family and friends had been getting ready to move base. They
            would never be able to find his guardians. The boy had expressed
            being fine with living on Mikumo&rsquo;s beach. It was safe, he got
            to see the sun, and he thought the teen was very nice, even if
            others feared him.

            Part of Mikumo inwardly protested. He loved having Kouta around, but
            the kid deserved someone better than him. Someone who wasn&rsquo;t a
            monster, a demon. He tried to send him to the group living within
            his protection. The people had ignored Kouta&rsquo;s existence,
            whispering about The Tengu&rsquo;s child behind his back. He
            didn&rsquo;t try to send the boy away again after that.

            Kouta had turned eight on the twelfth of December, but Mikumo
            didn&rsquo;t pay attention to the dates much anymore. They had
            celebrated sometime during the winter either way, with Mikumo
            finding the ingredients to make a small cake. As well as present a
            necklace with one of his feathers tied in thin metal.

            At some point, the teen had shared his notebooks, sketches, and some
            of his memories with the kid. Inspiring him to make his own notebook
            full of sketches and the tales of people he met. One tale had been
            his own parents, dead at the hands of a mass murderer by the name
            Muscular. They had been heroes. They had left him behind trying to
            protect people they didn't know.

            He had led Kouta to the cemetery within Musutafu and brought him to
            a grave surrounded by budding flowers and young trees.
            <em>Midoriya Inko</em>. He told him the tale of Midoriya Izuku. The
            boy who had dreamed of being a hero as everyone told him that he
            couldn&rsquo;t, even heroes, until he broke. Until he lost his own
            mother. Until he was taken in by a villain.
        </p>

        <p>
            He did not tell him more than that, let the boy form his own
            conclusions with time. Yami&rsquo;s tale was much darker than
            Izuku&rsquo;s. Mikumo&rsquo;s was only still beginning.

            &ldquo;Hey, Mikumo!&rdquo; Kouta knocked the young man from his
            thoughts. The midday sun glistened on the ocean&rsquo;s surface.
        </p>

        <p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;Can I fire this?&rdquo; Kouta held up the rail gun Mikumo
            managed to make, <em>complete this time</em>, out of scrap metal and
            wire he had collected when cleaning the currently pristine beach.
            Coils of wire ran along both sides of a barrel, that when supplied
            with current, could generate a lot of magnetic force to shoot metal
            objects at high speed. &ldquo;Please?&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            &ldquo;What?! No! You need an electric quirk to do so anyway.&rdquo;
            An easy lie, he could probably find a way to connect the gun to the
            battery in the house. Did he want to? No. That invention was liable
            to tear itself apart at any moment when he powered it.
        </p>

        <p>&ldquo;Aww, you&rsquo;re no fun anymore!&rdquo;</p>

        <p>
            Mikumo gasped, affronted, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still plenty fun!&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>&ldquo;Prove it.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>
            About a minute of being blind after stretching <em>Blink</em> to the
            limits was totally worth dunking both of them into the ocean only a
            moment later. Kouta&rsquo;s scream had been glorious.
