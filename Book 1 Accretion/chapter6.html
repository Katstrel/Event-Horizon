			</p>

			<p>
				Mikumo sat around the small table within the camper, drawing different
				flowers and constellations within a notebook. He was taking a break from
				the analysis he had done on the recent noumu he encountered. Trying to
				figure out what quirk they had after taking them down was a bit like a
				game.
			</p>

			<p>
				One that he never had the answers for unless he had worked on the
				specific noumu with the doctor due to his refusal to use
				<em>All for One</em> as it wanted and longed for. Writing and drawing
				always lessened the itch to use, to transfer, to <em>take</em>. He
				hardly minded the feeling anymore, a gentle reminder in the back of his
				mind that he wasn&rsquo;t normal.
			</p>

			<p>
				His focus was interrupted with a knock on the door that woke Kouta up
				from where he slept on their bed. An older woman stood at the door as he
				opened it, &ldquo;Tengu, please! You have to help us!&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Huh? What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p>

			<p>
				The woman looked at him, shocked, for only a moment before continuing,
				&ldquo;There's a large beast. A dog. It&rsquo;s going to kill us all!
				Please kill it! Please save us, please save my husband.&rdquo; The
				desperation in her voice called to him. He had to help.
			</p>

			<p>
				Before he could answer, Kouta came up beside him and accusingly asked,
				&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to go, aren&rsquo;t you? They don&rsquo;t even
				like you.&rdquo; The boy&rsquo;s composure broke as he slightly cried,
				&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				Mikumo understood. The boy's parents died protecting other people, who
				then celebrated their deaths as if them dying was a good thing. It was
				more than helping the people within his territory, though. &ldquo;If the
				noumu is within the perimeter, then I need to drive it out or kill it to
				protect you too. I&rsquo;m not only going for them, but for you.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t go, Mikumo!&rdquo;</p>

			<p>
				He held back a sigh and looked Kouta in his dark blue eyes, &ldquo;I
				promise I will come back.&rdquo; The young man then smiled, &ldquo;When
				has a noumu ever caused me trouble?&rdquo; Well, Pyracmon came to mind,
				but Kouta doesn&rsquo;t need to know about anything from the arena
				stained with blood. He turned back to the woman who still stared at him
				with wide eyes, &ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br />
		<hr />

		<div class="patriciapoem" align="center">
			<p>
				<b
					>Even Light cannot escape this destiny.<br />
					So you surrender<br />
					You let yourself plummet toward the Dark Unknown,<br />
					Falling toward the truth of what You Are.</b

			</p>

		<hr />
		<br />

		<div>
			<p>
				A faint blue light trailed in his steps as he ran across the rooftops of
				Musutafu. The dog noumu was already within his sights. It towered at
				about two stories tall, with muted blue and gray fur thinning along its
				tail into a thin whip. Quirks already fired all around it as the beast
				growled, the noise rumbling like thunder in the distance.
			</p>

			<p>
				Its eyes seemed to be unable to focus as it looked around as they bulged
				from its skull below an exposed brain. Large fangs poked out from the
				bottom jaw on one side. This was a creature he helped create&hellip;
				codename Boreas. The tail quickly whizzed past him before taking out the
				building behind him he had just been running across.
			</p>

			<p>
				As he approached the scene, the air seemed to cool until his own breath
				fogged in the air. The people below him were already shivering to fight
				off the chill while they fought for their lives. In a flash of pink, two
				large knives found themselves in his grip. Go time.
			</p>

			<p>
				Without slowing or missing a beat, he leaped from the roofs, wings
				opening to catch the air, claws coming down to curl into the giant
				canine&rsquo;s fur as he continued his sprint. The sooner he took it
				down, the safer everyone would be. Ice shot up from the creature&rsquo;s
				skin, <em>great</em>. He struggled to dodge as the noumu&rsquo;s
				attention fully turned to him. He managed to reach the beast&rsquo;s
				shoulders before a pillar finally caught him, launching him off its
				back.
			</p>

			<p>
				Rolling in midair with the slight thrust of his wings, he managed to
				somewhat catch himself. He swung his right blade out, cutting deep
				within the flesh of the noumu&rsquo;s foreleg and slowing his own fall
				as he landed. Blood flowed freely down from the fresh wound, partially
				drenching Mikumo in dark red.
			</p>

			<p>
				His small victory was short-lived, though, as he watched the cut slowly
				knit itself back together. As if the noumu had never been injured. The
				beast let off a low growl, fully turning to face Mikumo, oh he was
				<em>fucked</em>. <em>Nyoom</em> activated, and he leapt back with a flap
				of his small wings as giant jaws snapped down where he had been
				standing.
			</p>

			<p>
				He looked around for anything or anyone that could help him injure the
				dog enough to keep it down while he went for the brain, but all the
				people that had previously been slinging their quirks at it had stopped.
				They stood a ways away, down the road, and <em>watched</em>. He
				couldn&rsquo;t help but think of hero society before The Fall. Civilians
				had watched and cheered as heroes fought for all of their lives.
			</p>

			<p>
				A howl knocked him from his thoughts and he <em>blinked</em> to the
				other side of the beast as a large paw came down and cracked the
				concrete below it. Steeling himself, he brought forward
				<em>Taser</em> as he teleported again and again and <em>again</em>. Each
				time cutting deeply through fur and skin and muscle as he fell around on
				all sides of Boreas time after time. Tail and teeth and ice nearly hit
				him on more than one occasion.
			</p>

			<p>
				A fight of attrition as the dog&rsquo;s attacks gradually slowed and
				darkness creeped at the edges of Mikumo&rsquo;s vision. Cuts and blood
				covered the creature as tingling numbness climbed up his fingers and
				arms. The people below only <em>watched</em>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Boreas caught him with its snout, flinging him into a building as it
				quickly turned its head. <em>Minor Healing</em> hummed in his veins,
				while scrapes and bruises made themselves known all across his body.
				This had to end.
			</p>

			<p>
				In one last bid, pink light swapped his knives out for a metal pole he
				collected months ago. He <em>blinked</em>, falling through the air above
				the noumu&rsquo;s head. Twisting to wrap his weight around the pole and
				directing it downwards. Electricity hummed in the air as he brought
				<em>Taser</em> to the upper limits of what he had ever attempted.
			</p>

			<p>
				Electricity arced across the creature&rsquo;s brain as the pole buried
				itself deep within the soft flesh. It seized and fell slightly to the
				side, howling in pain, as Mikumo hung on for dear life, continuing to
				supply the current. <em>Taser</em> eventually gave out as his own nerves
				buzzed in protest to its use.
			</p>

			<p>
				Slowly, Mikumo called forth one of his knives again and started the
				arduous task of cutting the giant noumu&rsquo;s brain stem to take it
				out completely. Man, he could really use a nap after this. Although, of
				course, anything that could go wrong almost always seemed to do so
				around him, as Boreas whined and shakily started getting to its feet.
			</p>

			<p>Tired and in a panic, his palms itched, and he gave in.</p>
		</div>

		<br />

		<br />

		<div>
			<p>
				Izumi Kouta caught up with the group from the nearby settlement as they
				all watched the giant dog fall over. Mikumo was hanging on to the
				noumu&rsquo;s exposed brain. The crowd cheered, and the boy
				couldn&rsquo;t help but feel like he was back to society before The Fall
				of Heroes. These people were cheering as his family risked their lives
				for them.
			</p>

			<p>
				The white haired man looked so tired as he continued to work on killing
				the creature. Kouta wouldn&rsquo;t celebrate until the noumu was truly
				dead and Mikumo was back home with him, resting. Dark blue eyes watched
				the moment the dog started to get up, watched in horror as terror
				entered star shaped pupils.
			</p>

			<p>
				He was there to watch as bright cyan and black ribbons grew within the
				air, seeming to originate from Mikumo. Twisting to connect the two
				beings with a string of pure energy. Weaving into and out of the
				noumu&rsquo;s skin in a beautiful display until the creature fell to the
				side once more, lifeless. Mikumo falling down beside it, unconscious, as
				the light receded into him.
			</p>

			<p>
				Kouta&rsquo;s feet moved on their own as he raced past the people
				cheering and murmuring beside him. He had to make sure Mikumo was okay.
				The boy had never seen an ability quite like that. Whatever it did, it
				completely took out the noumu and knocked the white haired man out.
				Thankfully, he was still breathing when Kouta arrived by his side.
			</p>

			<p>
				Slowly, other people started to approach. The woman from before at the
				forefront. &ldquo;Do you need help?&rdquo; she asked quietly. &ldquo;I-
				I want to give my thanks and also show my apologies for not seeing the
				Tengu as human before. He&rsquo;s just like us, isn&rsquo;t he? Despite
				the fact he has multiple quirks like those monsters&hellip; He&rsquo;s
				just another person.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				Before Kouta could respond, a guy who looked to be in his thirties
				appeared. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be ridiculous! We should kill the beast
				while it&rsquo;s down! How long have we lived in fear of it turning on
				us? How long will it choose to let us live here?&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				Another man spoke up, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the only one being ridiculous
				here! It responded to our call for help. It saved us. Would we have been
				able to take down that hellhound ourselves?&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				The bickering continued, completely unfazed by Kouta&rsquo;s presence as
				he stood next to Mikumo. Panic creeped into his shortened breath, he
				needed to get Mikumo away from these people. Thankfully, a small group
				of other kids his age came up to him.
			</p>

			<p>
				A girl only a few years older than him spoke up quietly as the adults
				started yelling, &ldquo;Hey. You&rsquo;re the kid the Tengu watches
				over, right? Want help getting him back to where you live?&rdquo; He
				could only nod.
			</p>

			<p>
				They had been travelling for weeks, he wasn&rsquo;t sure how many. The
				only thing that made it bearable was eviscerating any two-bit creature
				that thought it could take them on. Also, having Shitty Hair and Raccoon
				Eyes by his side. Dunce Face was back at the main base with Nedzu to
				help power everything with his quirk. Sero Hanta&hellip; best to not
				reminisce while in the open.
			</p>

			<p>
				Exhibitionist and Elf had to leave behind the periwinkle woman, Hadou
				Nejire, that had been part of their group back at the main base after
				bringing her for medical attention. Katsuki wasn&rsquo;t about to let
				the blond leave again with only one extra for backup. After all, he was
				a massive target for All for fucking One. It was why he and the Elf
				couldn&rsquo;t stay till their friend had healed up.
			</p>

			<p>
				At this point, every tree, rock, and building looked the same to
				Katsuki. He couldn&rsquo;t tell you what side of Japan they were even
				on. Well, until he saw three jagged towers made of glass and steel
				reaching into the sky on the horizon. A single bridge was still intact,
				while another had crumbled away from the initial attack and exposure to
				the elements afterward. UA High School.
			</p>

			<p>
				They were nearing the outskirts of Musutafu. He couldn&rsquo;t help but
				long to walk through the streets below on the other side of that hill.
				&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fucking UA, right?&rdquo; The elf bastard muttered a
				soft confirmation. &ldquo;Could we swing by Musutafu? There&rsquo;s a
				few places I want to check on.&rdquo; He wanted to offer another update
				to Inko. The extras be damned.
			</p>

			<p>
				Exhibitionist glanced at him before speaking up with a soft smile,
				&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, you grew up around UA in Musutafu. I
				don&rsquo;t see why not. Where are we headed?&rdquo;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br />
		<hr />
		<br />

		<div>
			<p>
				Ruins of buildings that were wrapped in vines passed them by. Grass grew
				thickly through thin cracks in the concrete walkways. Few noumu
				interrupted them, thinning more and more as they descended into the
				heart of the metropolis. The absence of noumu only made them more aware
				of their surroundings as they continued far past the invisible barrier.
			</p>

			<p>
				Eventually, Katsuki stood at the entrance of the cemetery that housed
				Auntie Inko. Raccoon Eyes tilted her head as if to ask more about why he
				wanted to come here, but he never felt like explaining. Shitty Hair
				placed his hand on his shoulder with a comforting smile. Maybe he could
				just this once.
			</p>

			<p>
				&ldquo;I- This is-&rdquo; Damn, he sounded like the fucking nerd. He
				sighed, &ldquo;My aunt is buried here. I liked to visit her with updates
				before everything went to shit. It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve
				managed to even come say hello, as you all can imagine. She had a son,
				our age. I was an asshole to him, and he disappeared shortly after her
				death&hellip; I regret it.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				&ldquo;Do you want us to join you or leave you be?&rdquo; Eijirou was
				always too kind to him. It was more than he deserved. No questions about
				what he did or remarks about who he was before UA. He appreciated it
				more than he could ever say.
			</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Yeah, you can come.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>
				The peppy highlighter yellow blond intruded the moment,
				&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll leave you three be then and stand guard here.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				At least it would just be him, Eijirou, and Mina. &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				Making their way through the grave site, flowers of all kinds bloomed on
				the sides of the walkway. Raccoon Eyes spoke up first as they lost sight
				of the other two extras. &ldquo;Oh this is so pretty! Although
				it&rsquo;s strange that the cemetery is still so well
				kept&hellip;&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				Now that she brought it up, yeah, this was strange. Shitty Hair tried to
				offer an answer, &ldquo;Maybe someone has family buried here and plenty
				of time to take care of the rest of the place? The area does seem to be
				quite peaceful&hellip;&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo; The two stared at him, &ldquo;The
				peace. Something is wrong with it. It shouldn&rsquo;t exist out here.
				There is always a calm before the storm.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				The trio stayed quiet after that as they continued walking along winding
				pathways bordered by lilies, roses, daisies, daffodils, and so many more
				types of flowers. A rainbow of colors passed them by as Katsuki led his
				friends through a route he knew like the back of his own hand.
			</p>

			<p>
				Although, he slowed as Inko&rsquo;s grave came within sight, drowning in
				a sea of flowers as a young cherry blossom sprouted nearby. It was
				beautifully looked after. The blond only knew one person who would have
				and <em>could</em> have done this. <em>&ldquo;Holy shit.&rdquo;</em>
			</p>

			<p>&ldquo;What is it, bro?&rdquo;</p>

			<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my Auntie&rsquo;s grave.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>
				&ldquo;What?! So whoever has been taking care of this place also knows
				your aunt? That&rsquo;s crazy.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Izuku.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>
				Silence. &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; They didn&rsquo;t remember their run in with
				Yami? Wait, it was Mikumo. Fuck. He sighed, they did have larger
				problems at the time, as the guy had some type of fit immediately
				following his cryptic question from an outside perspective.
			</p>

			<p>
				&ldquo;Midoriya Izuku, my cousin.&rdquo; Quieter, &ldquo;My
				brother.&rdquo; His mom had mentioned it once near the start of high
				school. The two of them had grown up together, practically at the hip.
				It had felt right. Despite their mothers not being related, they called
				each other&rsquo;s parents their aunts and uncles. If not brothers, they
				were still cousins. Family. Even if they were not related by blood.
			</p>

			<p>
				They later returned to Elf and Exhibitionist with many more questions
				stewing within Katsuki&rsquo;s mind. He almost wanted to ask that they
				stay here to catch the fucking nerd in the act so he could see the guy
				for himself. Alas, he <em>knew</em> they had to keep moving.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br />
		<hr />
		<br />

		<div>
			<p>
				It was only the next day when they came across a full on settlement. The
				people called it New Musutafu. Mirio found it confusing as the people
				ran and played, and shouted throughout the streets surrounding their few
				city blocks of territory. They had little fear of the monstrous
				creatures, abominations of nature, that used to only exist in
				nightmares.
			</p>

			<p>
				He tried to ask them why the city was abandoned by the noumu and the
				only answer they would give was, &ldquo;The Tengu keeps the other
				monsters away.&rdquo; <em>What was the Tengu?</em> Apparently the
				creature was also why villains that chose to roam the countryside rather
				than follow All for One avoided the city as well.
			</p>

			<p>
				After more questioning, the party of heroes found a small portion of the
				people spitting hostility towards the creature. They feared it despite
				its passive and even somewhat kind demeanor towards the people. They
				described their displeasure of not being allowed to kill it when it had
				fallen after taking out a hellish hound that towered six meters tall and
				froze the surrounding air only a few days prior.
			</p>

			<p>
				Those within that minority had begged them to kill it, to save them from
				it. The rest of the people had described a fight they would not have
				survived without the creature&rsquo;s help, it had saved them.
				Intrigued, the group had decided to check on the creature the people had
				called the Tengu for themselves within the old Takoba Municipal Beach
				Park.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br />
		<hr />
		<br />

		<div>
			<p>
				Kouta stood outside the camper while Mikumo continued to sleep on the
				single bed inside. It had been days since the older teen fell
				unconscious, and the boy couldn&rsquo;t help but worry about if he would
				ever wake up again. Whatever the cyan and black light had been, it had
				killed the noumu and did something to Mikumo. Did it almost kill him
				too?
			</p>

			<p>
				He wandered into the raised gardens and picked a variety of berries from
				their stems to eat as his lunch. At least Mikumo had taught him how to
				look over the plants and how to tell when they were ready to eat. He
				would be just fine until the avian woke up. Although, he was lonely. How
				did Mikumo stand the silence before taking him in?
			</p>

			<p>
				To pass the time, he began training with his quirk again, even though he
				shouldn&rsquo;t without supervision. It was simple enough anyway.
				<em>Water Gun</em> allowed him to shoot water from his hands, simple in
				nature, but even simple quirks can be powerful. They had tested if he
				could direct the water or increase the pressure, or even if he could
				shoot from other parts of his body or even from just one finger.
			</p>

			<p>
				Kouta already had some control over the pressure he shot the water at,
				but when focused on only one finger, the pressure naturally increased
				from the smaller area. It was so cool! So far, his only drawback seemed
				to be needing to drink way more water. Mikumo explained that each quirk
				had a drawback, whether it was passive or only when someone used their
				quirk or even only when they used their quirk too much.
			</p>

			<p>
				Everyone&rsquo;s power had a price. Resistance to it could be trained
				depending on the drawback. Kouta&rsquo;s drawback was a bit more serious
				and couldn&rsquo;t be ignored. He wasn&rsquo;t allowed to train without
				fresh water already nearby for him.
			</p>

			<p>
				The sound of distant footsteps broke through his thoughts. Dark blue
				eyes looked over to the steps leading down to the beach as a group of
				people came into view. Dread coursed through him, it was likely the
				people who wanted to take Mikumo away. He quickly dove for cover and
				mentally readied for a fight. He wouldn&rsquo;t let them take his
				family. <em>Not again</em>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Although, surprise soon replaced his resolve. The group up on the
				balcony was Mirio, Tamaki, Katsuki, Mina, and Eijirou! He couldn&rsquo;t
				help his excitement as he ran towards the stairs at high speed,
				&ldquo;How are you guys here?!&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				They all stared at him with large eyes as he climbed the stairs as
				quickly as he could. Mina was the first to recover and say something,
				&ldquo;What?! Kouta?!&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				&ldquo;What the fu&ndash;&rdquo; Mina slapped her hand over
				Katsuki&rsquo;s mouth, cutting him off.
			</p>

			<p>
				The bright blond that was able to use multiple quirks like Mikumo chimed
				in to ask, &ldquo;Kouta? &hellip; How? How did you end up here?&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				&ldquo;Oh! Well, a noumu chased me into the city a looong time ago and
				Mikumo saved me! I knew Nedzu was moving base again soon and that even
				if he helped me look for you guys, we would probably never find you
				all&hellip; So I stayed here! Mikumo has been super nice and cool and
				amazing! You should meet him!&rdquo; He paused, &ldquo;Well&hellip; when
				he wakes up.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				Katsuki had stiffened when he mentioned Mikumo, but Kouta quickly
				dismissed it before the sandy blond pushed Mina&rsquo;s hand away and
				asked softly, &ldquo;Mikumo, he&rsquo;s here? Holy&ndash;&rdquo; Mina
				swatted at him, &ldquo;crap.&rdquo; He then burst into laughter,
				&ldquo;Of course, he could never ignore someone in need and just
				fu&ndash;&rdquo; another swat, &ldquo;&ndash;cking adopted you!&rdquo;
				Mina sighed as Katsuki continued, &ldquo;Can we see him?&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				Kouta looked to the side, &ldquo;Well&hellip; He hasn&rsquo;t woken up
				yet. He&hellip; He&rsquo;s been sleeping for days. He has never needed
				this long to recover from a fight! &hellip; I&rsquo;m scared. There was
				this weird light that I&rsquo;ve never seen before. It killed the noumu
				and knocked him out.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				A few moments later, Katsuki asked once again but this time in an
				uncharacteristically quiet voice, &ldquo;Can I see him?&rdquo;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br />
		<hr />
		<br />

		<div>
			<p>
				Awareness came back slowly, even then it wasn&rsquo;t awareness of his
				surroundings. No, this was the world within his mind. Mikumo had found
				that the colorful stars he had taken existed within a space inside his
				quirk, inside his mind, inside his soul. It was hard to tell the
				specifics with quirks sometimes when they broke the barrier of logic or
				the loose pseudo-science surrounding them beyond Alpha Elements.
			</p>

			<p>
				He stood on an approximation of Takoba Beach as the sun hung low on the
				horizon over the ocean. The ruins of Musutafu brokenly reached into the
				sky behind him. Above it all sat a black hole with stars slowly swirling
				around it, leaving colorful streaks in their wake. The sky beyond was
				looked like static as the nearly colorless void swirled in time with his
				own thoughts and emotions. A fuzzy, faded, cyan color would sometimes
				peek through along with deeper blues, turquoise, and other
				bluish-greens.
			</p>

			<p>
				Many hours and many nights had been spent slowly crafting this space. It
				had started with the stars floating aimlessly within the void as he
				walked around on nothing. Sometimes when the thoughts became too much,
				he would allow himself to drift into this dreamscape instead and spend
				time analyzing the quirks or rearranging some portion of the sky above.
			</p>

			<p>
				Looking at his personal galaxy as it twirled around above him, five new
				stars hung in the sky.
			</p>

			<p>
				That&rsquo;s right, he had surrendered to the itch in his palms and had
				<em>pulled</em>. He had taken quirks for the first time in two years.
				It&hellip; it felt good.
			</p>

			<p>
				Maybe it would be okay to <em>take</em> again? He had used the Demon
				King&rsquo;s quirk to do good. He had used <em>All for One</em> to save
				others. The avian stared up into the abyss beyond the event horizon. How
				had he forgotten that a quirk didn&rsquo;t make someone good or bad?
			</p>

			<p>
				It was probably when he saw the same quirk tear through dozens of Pro
				Heroes as if their training meant nothing, leaving them quirkless or
				dead in its wake.
			</p>

			<p>
				Mikumo wasn&rsquo;t like that, though. He would never use his quirk like
				that. The yokai were spirits, demons that were frequently portrayed as
				malevolent entities, not caring for the lives of others. Yet, some were
				also shown to be protectors, signs of good fortune, or simple entities
				that just wanted to exist. He may be a demon, but not all demons were
				evil like the Demon King.
			</p>

			<p>
				He was starting to get tired of ignoring the itch anyway. Ignoring the
				truth of what he was. The sky above brightened into a glorious mix of
				cyan, turquoise, and blue as his resolve hardened. Mikumo knew who he
				was, who he used to be, <em>what</em> he was, and it was time he
				accepted the entirety of his own existence.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br />
		<hr />
		<br />

		<div>
			<p>
				He awoke slowly. A slight soreness is his jaw, a new chill in his bones,
				warmth within his skin. Mikumo stretched his aching muscles as his claws
				curled in the air at the end of his bed and wings shifted under the cozy
				blankets draped across him. He grabbed at the soft fabric and curled
				tighter into a ball again.
			</p>

			<p>
				A noise he didn&rsquo;t notice previously dimmed before a child&rsquo;s
				voice called out, &ldquo;Mikumo!&rdquo; He only hummed in response to
				Kouta. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re awake!&rdquo; The boy started tugging on the
				blanket as Mikumo held tighter to it and curled up further. Undeterred,
				Kouta moved on to shaking him while complaining, &ldquo;Come on,
				you&rsquo;ve been asleep for days!&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				&ldquo;Kouta, let him continue sleeping if he wants to.&rdquo; The avian
				jolted up at the new, soft voice in his home. It originated from a raven
				haired man with pointed ears that seemed to curl in on himself slightly
				as Mikumo looked at him.
			</p>

			<p>
				&ldquo;But, Tamaki! Mikumo surely slept enough already!&rdquo; Kouta
				whined as green eyes turned to the other occupants in his camper home.
				Next to Tamaki sat a blond with blue eyes and diamond shaped pupils who
				looked very famili&ndash; <em>Lemillion</em>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Tamaki started to counter Kouta, &ldquo;And whatever happ&ndash;&rdquo;
				Mikumo didn&rsquo;t listen, though. He <em>blinked</em>.
			</p>

			<p>
				He didn&rsquo;t teleport far away, just to his balcony positioned above
				his home. He needed a moment to process <em>fucking Lemillion</em>, the
				hero that could stand against All for One and live to tell the tale.
				Alas, he didn&rsquo;t get that moment as a high pitch scream sounded
				next to him, and he screamed in shock with them.
			</p>

			<p>
				A girl around his age with pink skin and hair with yellow antlers stared
				at him with yellow eyes surrounded by black sclera. &ldquo;You!&rdquo;
				The only reason he didn&rsquo;t immediately teleport to the nearest
				rooftop instead was how excited she sounded to see him. It was
				confusing.
			</p>

			<p>&ldquo;H-Huh? Me?&rdquo;</p>

			<p>
				&ldquo;Yes, you! You&rsquo;ve been sleeping for so long! Had a nice
				nap?&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				&ldquo;Uh, I guess?&rdquo; That was the second time someone brought up
				how long he apparently had been sleeping. &ldquo;Has it really been
				days?&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				&ldquo;Yeah, it has. If you don&rsquo;t mind me asking, what happened?
				We&rsquo;ve heard parts of it from the people in New Musutafu and from
				Kouta. Mostly about how you took out a giant dog noumu by yourself,
				that&rsquo;s so cool!&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				&ldquo;Thanks?&rdquo; He was considering if he would really bring up and
				explain <em>All for One</em> to her despite being a stranger or not when
				his musings were interrupted by a large explosion further down the
				shore. Probably for the best, he should tell Kouta first out of anyone,
				or at least have him be present.
			</p>

			<p>
				He initiated <em>Nyoom</em> to begin the sprint to investigate what went
				off when several more explosions rang out from the air. A small speck
				became visible in the sky as explosions propelled it swiftly through the
				air. Mikumo knew that quirk, he had theorized that flight could one day
				be possible if the user dared to try. <em>Kacchan</em>.
			</p>

			<p>
				&ldquo;Kacchan?&rdquo; Damn, he spoke out loud? Fuck, was he even ready
				to confront the explosive blond? Actually, just what were these last few
				minutes?! Maybe he&rsquo;s still asleep and dreaming. That made more
				sense than this fever dream. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a dream,
				silly!&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				Oh come on, let him dream. Kacchan landed roughly on the deck, barking
				out, &ldquo;Oi.&rdquo; in greeting. Emerald green met ruby red. He
				didn&rsquo;t have any words for the blond, despite longing to see him
				again. He had avoided looking for him, except that one time Kacchan gave
				him his name back, out of fear. The explosive teen cocked his head
				slightly back and to the side, &ldquo;What happened to you,
				Izuku?&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				Izuku, he could be Izuku at this moment with his old best friend
				standing by his side calling him by his <em>name</em> instead of Deku,
				<em>instead of useless</em>, stilled further as his sight blurred. He
				only had one answer, &ldquo;So&ndash; so much, Kacchan.&rdquo; His feet
				moved on their own as he wrapped himself around his brother in all but
				blood and cried for the first time in a long time.

				Later, as the sun hung low above the sea, he tells of the day his
				notebook was burned four years ago. Drowning as sentient sludge taunted
				him, All Might saving his life, the hero telling him he could never be a
				hero too. Falling into the abyss of quirk science, receiving an offer to
				be an assistant, his mother&rsquo;s death within an afternoon shortly
				after, and his acceptance for the position within the silence of the
				apartment.
			</p>

			<p>
				Recounts how kind the doctor had been, giving him anything he asked for,
				making him feel useful, all in exchange for following his directions,
				his orders. When he failed, he described the isolation of a white room
				and the kindness afterward. How things stayed the same until the new
				year, helping to set up Adonis. Of the betrayal, as the doctor drugged
				him, saying that he was the perfect test subject to make sure Adonis
				would work.
			</p>

			<p>
				Recounts his fuzzy, broken memories at the time and a compelling sense
				to follow the doctor&rsquo;s every word. Being forced to use his new,
				artificial quirk until he fell over from the pain. Waking up in a blood
				stained arena, forced to fight for the first time. It wasn&rsquo;t the
				last fight in that arena. His first kill as he stabbed a noumu through
				the brain sometime in the months afterward.
			</p>

			<p>
				Recounts the day of the Jaku Hospital Raid. As the walls cracked around
				them and the hospital crashed down. Losing his home in the wake of
				oppressive dust. Of saving two heroes while leaving Garaki to surrender
				to a fate of his own making. Technically, the first time he killed
				someone. Of Eraserhead&rsquo;s offer and his decision to leave them
				behind, to wander.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<p>
				Mikumo didn&rsquo;t tell Kacchan everything. He left a lot unsaid. After
				a while, as the sun began to properly set against the horizon, the young
				white haired man collected ingredients for a nice dinner from his
				gardens. The group would stay for a few weeks at most. It would be his
				decision to go with them or stay here at the end of it.
			</p>

			<p>
				They still didn&rsquo;t know the full extent of what he could do,
				though. They didn&rsquo;t fully know what he was. He was still too much
				of a coward to tell them, despite his confidence in himself. If he truly
				wanted to go, he would need to tell them the truth of what he was first.
			</p>

			<p>
				The people who lived within his protection zone called him a demon. It
				was the truth of what he was after the doctor&rsquo;s experiment on him.
				He was, truly, a demon. One with the exact same quirk as the Demon King.
				Even so, all the yokai were called demons, even the good spirited ones.
				Ones like the Tengu, a symbol of protection within the legends told by
				the older generations.
			</p>

			<p>
				It was only a few days later, everyone was out on the beach as the sun
				shone brightly overhead. Kouta practiced with his quirk along the shore
				while Mikumo sat nearby, Kacchan sitting next to him. Ashido and
				Kirishima chased Toogata while Amajiki hid in the shade of
				Mikumo&rsquo;s camper home.
			</p>

			<p>
				&ldquo;Hey, Kouta, catch!&rdquo; Mikumo threw a strawberry to the boy as
				he continued eating the fruit himself. Alas, in his inattention, he bit
				his lip <em>again</em>. The longer canines from <em>Fangs</em> were
				starting to get on his nerves. The area around the cut seemed to buzz as
				it knit itself back together. Praised be <em>Regeneration</em>,
				<em>Lesser Healing</em> could never.
			</p>

			<p>
				He had been tempted to test out his new quirks, especially the ice
				quirk. Elemental quirks always seemed to be the most freeing, allowing
				the user to reshape their limitations. The downside was how they were
				more prone to react to the user&rsquo;s emotions. Quirk accident rates
				among elemental users had always been among the highest before The Fall.
			</p>

			<p>
				Boreas had used it to grow spikes made of ice and cool the surrounding
				air. When it tried to bite him, its breath had been freezing. It was
				likely he could use it to create a frost breath-like attack, similar to
				his father&rsquo;s fire breath. Now, that would be cool!
			</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Oi, what are you going on about?&rdquo;</p>

			<p>
				&ldquo;Ah! I was mumbling? I thought I quit that years ago.
				Sorry.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				Red eyes stared at him, &ldquo;Tch,&rdquo; before he turned back to the
				ocean. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t tell you to stop.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				&ldquo;O-oh&hellip;&rdquo; Wait. Mikumo stared incredulously at the
				blond. Part of him knew Kacchan could have changed a lot in the last
				four years too but, &ldquo;What?!&rdquo; He actually wanted to hear his
				quirk analysis thoughts?
			</p>

			<p>
				Kacchan sighed, &ldquo;Look, I&rsquo;m sorry for the shitty way I
				treated you before. My reasons for acting that way do not excuse my
				actions. I was a fucking idiot. So yeah, what are you whispering about
				over there, fucking nerd?&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				Damn. He was caught. With as much innocence as he could muster, he
				responded with, &ldquo;Nothing?&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				&ldquo;Oh come on! We both know that's a shitty lie!&rdquo; barked the
				explosive teen with no bite. &ldquo;I thought I heard something about
				Uncle Hisashi.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				&ldquo;Yeah&hellip; Okay, the noumu I fought was code-named Boreas. It
				had an ice quirk and I think it could have done something similar to
				Dad&rsquo;s quirk with ice!&rdquo; He paused, thinking it over before
				continuing, &ldquo;Good thing it didn&rsquo;t, but imagine!&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				&ldquo;Of course, only you would think of a way to make something that
				almost killed you scarier.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Hey, I had it under control!&rdquo;</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Passing out after the fight is not under control.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>
				&ldquo;That only happened because I used my trump card.&rdquo; Mikumo
				smiled mischievously.
			</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Oh yeah? What was it?&rdquo;</p>

			<p>
				Hook, line, and sinker. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to know,
				explosion boy!&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				Mikumo soon found himself using <em>Nyoom</em> as explosions sounded
				behind him. Both of them were laughing along the shoreline. He had
				missed this. He had missed his brother in all but blood standing by his
				side.
			</p>

			<p>
				Although, later, he couldn&rsquo;t help but ask the blond, &ldquo;Are
				you sure that you don&rsquo;t only care because I have a quirk
				now?&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				&ldquo;What? No, fuck no. Younger me was just an asshole, okay?&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>&ldquo;... Yeah, okay.&rdquo;</p>
		</div>

		<br />
		<hr />
		<br />

		<div>
			<p>
				This had been a mistake. Mikumo was regretting all of his life choices
				that led him to this moment. He had pulled out the rail gun to show
				everyone else since Kouta brought it up. The wire coil rails tore
				themselves apart as a round tried to shoot down the electrified barrel.
				The heat and pressure created forces similar to an explosion.
			</p>

			<p>He always had known this was a possibility.</p>

			<p>
				Thankfully, everyone else had kept their distance due to the output of
				<em>Taser</em> being very dangerous at high levels. They apparently had
				a friend with an electric quirk that would discharge it in large area
				blasts.
			</p>

			<p>
				His arms hurt like hell. Burns ran up to almost his elbow, while small
				bits of metal and wire seemed to dig into his skin. Someone was
				screaming. It was Kouta. &ldquo;Hey. Hey, Kouta. I&rsquo;m fine.
				I&rsquo;m going to be fine. I heal fast, remember?&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				The boy only stared as the burns slowly knitted back to unmarred skin
				while Mikumo worked to pick the scrap out of his arms.
				&ldquo;See?&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				Disbelief and a slight bit of the panic from before bled into his tone,
				&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t heal that fast before!&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				<em>Damn.</em> &ldquo;Ah, yeah&hellip; It&rsquo;s a new
				development&hellip; But, I&rsquo;m fine. That's what matters,
				right?&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				Alas, he could never hide anything from Kacchan. &ldquo;What do you
				fucking mean, a new development?! You&rsquo;re still experiencing
				aftereffects from the experimentation that fuck face did to you? Why
				didn&rsquo;t you say so?&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>&ldquo;I- This isn&rsquo;t from that! I&rsquo;m fine!&rdquo;</p>

			<p>
				&ldquo;You always insist that you&rsquo;re fine, even when you
				aren&rsquo;t! Stop that!&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				&ldquo;I-&rdquo; Red eyes seemed to plead with him, he sighed.
				&ldquo;Okay. Before fighting the giant dog noumu, I only had
				<em>Lesser Healing</em>. It slightly boosted my natural healing rate,
				allowing me to recover faster. Since then, I&rsquo;ve had
				<em>Regeneration</em>. True regeneration, that reverses most of the
				damage, if not all of it.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>Amajiki spoke up, &ldquo;So the quirk got an upgrade?&rdquo;</p>

			<p>
				It would be so easy to say yes, but Mikumo needed to explain this,
				didn&rsquo;t he? He found himself wanting to go with them more and more
				as he spent time with all of them. He had to reveal the truth of what he
				could do eventually. He wanted to, despite the anxiety rolling within
				his chest. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>Toogata spoke up, &ldquo;A new quirk?&rdquo;</p>

			<p>
				Mikumo paused for only a moment, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; He was doing this.
				&ldquo;The doctor used me as a test for one quirk to make sure a project
				called Adonis would even work by using a copy of the quirk later given
				to Shigaraki Tomura.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				He activated his quirk, allowing cyan and black energy to swirl around
				him in the air. &ldquo;My quirk is called <em>All for One</em>. The
				ability to give and take quirks. The exact same quirk used by All for
				One and Shigaraki. I couldn&rsquo;t defeat Boreas with the quirks I had,
				so I took all of its quirks to severely weaken it, if not outright kill
				it. <em>Regeneration</em> was one of them.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				Toogata seemed to stare at him critically, that was fine, while Kacchan
				muttered, &ldquo;Holy shit.&rdquo; Amajiki leaned against the bright
				blond, Kouta looked like he was having a realization about something,
				and Kirishima looked unsure.
			</p>

			<p>
				Ashido cut through the slightly awkward silence that followed and draped
				herself over his shoulders, startling him to drop his hold on
				<em>All for One</em>, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so cool! How many quirks do
				you have then?&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				&ldquo;Uh, eleven? Twelve if you count <em>All for One</em> itself.
				Boreas had five.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so manly!&rdquo;</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Thank you?&rdquo;</p>

			<p>
				&ldquo;Oi, nerd.&rdquo; The explosive blond smiled mischievously,
				&ldquo;Does that mean you were trying to figure out that ice quirk for
				yourself the other day?&rdquo;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br />
		<hr />
		<br />

		<div>
			<p>
				That's how Mikumo found himself running with <em>Nyoom</em> across the
				ocean as the surface of the water below him turned to ice with
				<em>Freeze</em>. The sun set to the west, bathing everything in a
				glimmering gold. Explosions sounded in the air behind him as he
				initiated <em>Blink</em> and <em>Giant</em>, falling into the sea from
				high above, splashing the blond and causing him to fall in too.
			</p>

			<p>
				Their laughter rang across the water, where the blue star shaped eyes of
				the ninth holder of <em>One for All</em> watched, unsure of this new
				development. Mikumo could be a fantastic ally to have against All for
				One, but he could just as easily be an unwilling enemy. Shigaraki Tomura
				had his mind and body overtaken by the ancient evil. Was Mikumo in
				danger of that as well?
			</p>

			<p>
				Hopefully they would never see the day when they have to fight two
				<em>All for One</em> holders again.

			<p>
				Shouta continued walking through the tunnel as his communicator buzzed,
				he could look at that later. Nedzu sat on his shoulders as he tapped
				away rapidly on a tablet. The only thing Shouta could make out from the
				mustelid was that he was tracking something big. Best to let him work
				uninterrupted.
			</p>

			<p>
				His communicator buzzed again, he tried to ignore it once more. It was
				likely just Hizashi spamming him with pictures of Eri, <em>again</em>.
				At least that was the plan before Nedzu tapped him, &ldquo;You should
				answer that.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				Never one to outright disobey the highly intelligent rat, the man
				finally looked at his messages. It was Amajiki Tamaki,
				&ldquo;Shit.&rdquo; Nedzu read the incoming messages with him over his
				shoulder. Not like he could stop the creature.
			</p>

			<p>
				&lsquo;<em
					>We have been camping out with the noumu identified as Yami for the

					found Izumi Kouta living with him. As suggested, he is quite friendly

					noumu.&rsquo;</em
				>
			</p>

			<p>
				&lsquo;<em
					>I&rsquo;m finally making this update due to new critical information.
					Mikumo was never created to be like the other noumu. His multiple
					quirks come from one quirk, the All for One quirk.&rsquo;</em
				>
			</p>

			<p>
				&lsquo;<em
					>Bakugou, Kirishima, and Ashido have managed to maintain positive
					relations with Mikumo post his reveal of his true abilities. How
					should we proceed?&rsquo;</em
				>
			</p>

			<p>
				Nedzu chittered beside his ear, &ldquo;This is most interesting, another
				<em>All for One</em> holder. One that doesn&rsquo;t follow the man
				himself, at that! Tell him to bring Mikumo back here if he can.
				Peacefully, we don&rsquo;t need another powerful enemy.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t know this beforehand?&rdquo;</p>

			<p>
				&ldquo;Nope! It&rsquo;s impossible to know everything, Shouta-kun!
				Mikumo is either very skilled at only showing what he wants others to
				know, or possibly neglected to use his real quirk! At the moment, I lean
				towards the latter being the most likely option, but be ready in case he
				truly is a master at deception.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>Shouta blinked, &ldquo;Is this wise?&rdquo;</p>

			<p>
				The stoat only smiled ferally, &ldquo;Sometimes large risks have the
				largest rewards. This is a calculated risk that I&rsquo;m willing to
				make. We need every advantage we can get against All for One.&rdquo;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br />
		<hr />
		<br />

		<div>
			<p>
				Tamaki placed his communicator back in his backpack. Mikumo was curled
				up asleep on the floor while Bakugou, Kirishima, and Ashido took over
				his bed. Kouta slept on top of the noumu, probably feeling better after
				watching the white haired man mess around with Bakugou and the others
				earlier in the day.
			</p>

			<p>
				He hadn&rsquo;t fully forgotten that Mikumo could be a threat, but it
				had been easy to overlook his classification as a <em>noumu</em> when
				the guy had been nothing but friendly and Mirio himself had multiple
				quirks. Knowing that he held <em>All for One</em> shouldn&rsquo;t have
				changed that, but it did. He could see it in Mirio too. They had spent
				so long being chased by All for One in a fucked up game of hide and
				seek.
			</p>

			<p>
				Neither of them could overlook the white hair, star shaped eyes, and
				black dots in his palms after knowing. Really, they should have noticed
				the similarities sooner. Tamaki could only guess that their minds
				didn&rsquo;t even want to consider having to face another All for One.
				At least Aizawa had told them to try recruiting this one to their fight
				against the other.
			</p>

			<p>
				Tamaki sighed and stood up from the small dining area Mikumo had within
				his camper home, walking out under the night sky. Mirio was still
				looking out over the ocean as it reflected the moonlight. &ldquo;Hey, I
				let Aizawa and Nedzu know of the situation. They said to recruit
				Mikumo.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				Mirio stayed silent for a few minutes as Tamaki sat down beside him in
				the sand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m worried for him.&rdquo; Tamaki hummed in
				questioning. &ldquo;Mikumo. I&rsquo;m worried about what All for One
				will do if he finds him. I&rsquo;m worried about whether the noumu
				programming is still within his mind, or if that man could take over his
				body like he did Shigaraki. Is it really safe for anyone if we take him
				with us?&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				&ldquo;Nedzu surely thought of this when making the decision, all we can
				do is trust the Rat God.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>&ldquo;... Yeah.&rdquo;</p>
		</div>

		<br />
		<hr />
		<br />

		<div>
			<p>
				When they had asked Mikumo to come with them back to the resistance led
				by Nedzu, he had quickly agreed. It hadn&rsquo;t taken him long to
				collect small things he kept around his home within <em>Pocket</em>. The
				group had quickly swung by Inko&rsquo;s grave to pay their final
				respects, likely the last time for a long while. After that, Mikumo had
				insisted on giving the settlement a heads-up that he was leaving.
			</p>

			<p>
				The people had refused to listen to him, like always, so Kirishima had
				stepped up to tell them the basics of the situation. Some of the people
				had quickly turned around, approaching Mikumo for the first time ever,
				and begged him to stay. Kouta quickly shouted at them for only wanting
				the man around for taking out the noumu. They didn&rsquo;t care about
				him otherwise, and, well, it was true.
			</p>

			<p>
				They had been making good time. It was barely noon as they stopped near
				Tatooin Station to eat a small lunch that Mikumo prepared before
				leaving. &ldquo;Hey, Kacchan, Aldera should be nearby. Want to burn it
				down?&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>&ldquo;You want to commit arson?&rdquo;</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Towards Aldera? Always.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>Kirishima asked, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s Aldera?&rdquo;</p>

			<p>
				&ldquo;Our shitty junior high. They treated Izuku like shit and never
				corrected my own fucked up behavior.&rdquo; Kacchan scoffed.
			</p>

			<p>
				&ldquo;... Ah. Let&rsquo;s do it then!&rdquo; The brothers
				couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh at his hesitant over enthusiasm to destroy
				their old school.
			</p>

			<p>
				Toogata, their de facto leader on the journey to a &lsquo;mouse
				hole&rsquo;, only sighed, &ldquo;Once we&rsquo;re done eating.&rdquo;
			</p>
		</div>

		<br />
		<hr />
		<br />

		<div>
			<p>
				Only a few minutes later, Mikumo felt a shift in the air. A gut instinct
				honed by months of hunting and fighting creatures and villains,
				protecting his small corner of the world. Something was coming.
				Something was trying to hunt <em>him</em>.
			</p>

			<p>
				The air seemed to chill as they all slowly paused from eating their
				meals. Toogata and Amajiki seemed to slowly shift into fighting
				positions while the others froze, waiting for the invisible shoe to
				drop. Mikumo&hellip; Mikumo wasn&rsquo;t even daring to breathe.
			</p>

			<p>
				A deep voice like honey and knives weaved through the air like silk,
				purring in a low tone, &ldquo;Ah, Toogata-kun&hellip;&rdquo; He could
				already see the smile that man always possessed in his mind.
			</p>

			<p>Mikumo <em>blinked</em>.</p>
		</div>

		<br />
		<hr />
		<br />

		<div>
			<p>
				Katsuki couldn&rsquo;t believe it when Izu- Mikumo, <em>damn it</em>,
				disappeared in a flicker of shadows at the edge of his vision. That
				damned nerd always ran, he just couldn&rsquo;t believe he would leave
				others behind in danger for once. Dread began to pool in his gut, Mikumo
				had been&ndash; No, <em>is</em> a noumu. Izuku had his mind messed with
				until he wouldn&rsquo;t even acknowledge his own name was still his. He
				saw himself as someone else. Something else.
			</p>

			<p>
				He wasn&rsquo;t ready to face his own family on the battlefield. He
				wasn&rsquo;t ready to watch Izuku mindlessly follow commands as if he
				wasn&rsquo;t a person. Katsuki wasn&rsquo;t a religious man, but he
				inwardly prayed and hoped that his newfound deepest fears weren&rsquo;t
				about to ring true. After all, a noumu with a dozen quirks that only
				cared for destruction with the nerd&rsquo;s intellect? They would never
				stand a chance.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br />
		<hr />
		<br />

		<div>
			<p>
				A man with white hair and black holes in his palms stepped out onto the
				street. His pupils were star shaped, like diamonds, surrounded by white
				irises. A scar across one side of his lip. A crisp suit that lacked any
				tie. The Demon King that paraded around in his new body, the body of
				Shigaraki Tomura.
			</p>

			<p>
				He spoke in a friendly tone, even while the pressure of his bloodlust
				was palatable in the air, &ldquo;I have come for my brother&hellip;
				again&rdquo; he drawled with a hint of displeasure. &ldquo;Will you
				surrender yet? I don&rsquo;t want to have to kill any of your friends
				here, but I will if I must for you to get the point.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				Mirio only smiled widely, just like his predecessors. Just like the
				previous holders of the quirk born from the demon&rsquo;s brother,
				<em>One for All</em>. He could feel them standing with him, by his side.
				&ldquo;Over my dead body, All for One.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				The ancient evil only cocked his head to the side, &ldquo;No? Very well.
				Maybe it&rsquo;s time I upped the stakes of this chase, you&rsquo;ve
				grown too used to the rules of the game. Good thing you brought that
				Beast Boy with you.&rdquo; He smiled with all teeth as red and black
				lightning filled the surrounding air. &ldquo;You seem quite attached to
				him after all.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				&ldquo;Pinky, take Kouta and get out of here. Suneater, Dynamight, with
				me. Red Riot, assist where needed.&rdquo; Mirio wasn&rsquo;t sure if he
				was relieved or angry that Mikumo had left the second All for One
				approached. He didn&rsquo;t need a wild card on the field, but at the
				same time, the extra firepower would have been appreciated.
			</p>

			<p>
				&ldquo;My, quite a plan.&rdquo; The demon flicked a finger, sending a
				massive gust crashing into a building near where Ashido was running. The
				girl quickly picked up Kouta, jumping to skate along on acid that she
				sprayed onto the street below her at a fast pace. Just narrowly
				outrunning the building crashing down into the street behind her.
				&ldquo;Ah, how unfortunate. That would have been a two for one
				deal!&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				Pale yellow and white lightning cloaked Mirio as
				<em>One for All</em> flooded into his veins. He leapt towards the man,
				aiming to kick him in the face before using <em>Permeation</em> to feint
				the attack as a hand came up to catch him. He descended into the ground,
				blind and deaf, at home, before becoming tangible and shooting into the
				sky.
			</p>

			<p>
				All for One had barely turned to face him as he used a flick to buffet
				the man and launch his teammates into the sky. Bakugou immediately
				ignited his palms in flight as Tamaki grew wings on his back to catch
				the air. He watched as Bakugou let off a blast of Howitzer Impact on the
				man, only barely burning him before regeneration undid the damage.
			</p>

			<p>
				The explosive blond continued the barrage of explosions as Red Riot ran
				in front, allowing the explosion to blast him like a cannonball through
				All for One as Tamaki swooped down through the air. Tentacles sprouted
				from his fingers, and twin scorpion tails twisted from his back. Scales
				and shells covered him in pseudo armor, nearly as tough as
				Kirishima&rsquo;s <em>Hardening</em>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Mirio landed and raced up to All for One while he was distracted with
				the three of them, punching as hard as he could before twisting into a
				kick, managing to launch the man into the side of a building. Rubble
				rained down as the demon began to laugh. &ldquo;And here I was thinking
				you would be boring! Good show, but it&rsquo;s not enough!&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				He disappeared only to reappear behind Tamaki a few seconds later,
				&ldquo;I did mention consequences for your continued resistance, yes?
				I&rsquo;ll be generous, your last chance. Give me Yoichi, or I&rsquo;ll
				take this friend of yours from you, too.&rdquo; Jagged red and black
				fingers wrapped around Tamaki&rsquo;s throat. Mirio froze.
			</p>

			<p>
				&ldquo;Ah, there we are. Now, give me <em>One for All</em> and
				I&rsquo;ll let him go. Sounds like a good deal, yes?&rdquo; The vestiges
				were screaming at the edges of his mind. He wasn&rsquo;t fully ready for
				the final fight. He was still missing one quirk from reaching full quirk
				singularity. <em>Gearshift</em>. Did he play his hand, reveal his cards,
				for the chance to save <em>Tamaki?</em>
			</p>

			<p>
				He didn&rsquo;t have to choose as a white blur slammed into the Demon
				King. Cyan and black wisps of energy floating through the air as a few
				white feathers fell in its wake. Black and red ribbons reached out to
				join it. A dizzying dance as colors twisted around each other and the
				energy hummed with an unnatural reverberation in the air.

				The ruined high rises of Musutafu stretched into the dim cyan and black
				void surrounding the teen&rsquo;s dreamscape. A kaleidoscope of color
				spun around the event horizon of <em>All for One</em>. The miniature
				spiral galaxy hung lowly over the city, haloed by the cyan light.
			</p>

			<p>
				Mikumo stood at the edge of the shoreline of his beach. His wings
				missing and his legs straight as toes rather than claws dug into the
				sand. This was his true form, how he looked when
				<em>All for One</em> was the only quirk he had.
			</p>

			<p>
				Pitch black water slowly lapped at the shore, eating away at the sand.
				Countless colors flashed within the suffocating depths. An eclipse sat
				along the sea&rsquo;s horizon with a crimson corona.
			</p>

			<p>
				Bathed in the sinister light, a tall man slowly stood up on the oily
				water, barely leaving a ripple on the surface. It was the true form of
				All for One, the body Mikumo had only briefly seen before the man stole
				Shigaraki&rsquo;s.
			</p>

			<p>
				&ldquo;What the fuck?&rdquo; Pearly white met emerald green,
				&ldquo;Yoichi?&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s eyes then flicked up to the sky
				above them, taking in the spiral of color. &ldquo;No&hellip;&rdquo; His
				gaze hardened back on Mikumo, &ldquo;Who the fuck are you?&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				Shoving his anxiety down, Mikumo channeled all his memories of All for
				One in his mind into mimicking the man. He let out a low, dangerous yet
				friendly chuckle as he smiled widely, &ldquo;Your worst
				nightmare.&rdquo; The black hole in the sky behind him let off a low hum
				as gravity shifted. The void&rsquo;s cyan tinge brightened like a
				brilliant nebula backdrop. Stars of color previously drowning in the
				depths of the black ocean began to slowly rise up into the sky around
				the man.
			</p>

			<p>
				&ldquo;Ah, I see now.&rdquo; The man smiled back with all teeth.
				&ldquo;My, how fascinating. Despite having the same quirk, you have a
				vastly different landscape for it in your mind. It seems you have truly
				made my quirk your own. Congratulations, Yami. Or should I say
				Midoriya-kun?&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				Mikumo didn&rsquo;t dare to grace the man with any type of reaction. He
				didn&rsquo;t feel the need to anyway. He knew who and what he was, even
				then, All for One didn&rsquo;t know anything. That man didn&rsquo;t know
				him. &ldquo;And here I was thinking we could be fabulous
				<em>business partners</em>.&rdquo; All for One sighed, &ldquo;What a
				waste.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				Crimson flared along the horizon as the dreamscape stuttered once more,
				some of the broken high rises in the imitation of Musutafu toppled over
				from the earthquake. Inky black water reached up like eldritch tentacles
				that wrapped around most of the stars and plunged them back down within
				its depths. All the while, the water receded from the shoreline.
			</p>

			<p>
				It rose up like towering walls of oil that blocked out what little light
				and color could be found within the sky behind the man. Within moments,
				it crashed down on the shore where he stood. Mikumo was drowning. He
				couldn&rsquo;t tell which way was up or down as colors of every hue and
				shade spun around him in the dark water.
			</p>

			<p><em>A voice laughed in his ear as he couldn&rsquo;t breathe</em>.</p>

			<p>No.</p>

			<p><em>His body wasn&rsquo;t his own.</em></p>

			<p><b>No.</b></p>

			<p><em>He watched as Shigaraki was taken over by All for One.</em></p>

			<p><b>N O .</b></p>

			<p>
				Mikumo refused to lose himself again. To just be a tool for others as
				they stripped him of his own autonomy, his memories, his free will.
				Unbeknownst to him, the sky within the void crackled with brilliant
				blue, turquoise, and cyan. Chasing away the encroaching red and crimson.
				He continued to float within the abyss as the black hole encompassing
				his own singularity above it all <em>sang</em>. The pressure tearing the
				water apart as quirks collected into constellations.
			</p>

			<p>
				He was running out of time to return to the surface.
				<em
					>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll only hurt for about forty-five
					seconds&hellip;&rdquo;</em
				>
				He could not panic. Focus. Another screech sounded out from the
				dreamscape that reverberated in his bones.
			</p>

			<p>
				A hand grabbed his collar and pulled him out of the water. White eyes
				stared at him with venom, &ldquo;You really are so much like my brother,
				<em>stop resisting</em>.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				Mikumo continued to cough the water out from his lungs as he responded,
				<em>&ldquo;Never.&rdquo;</em> The older teen would never follow another
				master again. He might sometimes go along with others, but that was his
				choice. He was his own, and he would die free.
			</p>

			<p>
				All for One sneered before the dreamscape&rsquo;s void like sky cracked
				with white and a piercing pain assaulted Mikumo&rsquo;s mind. If he was
				standing, he would have staggered. However, the Demon King seemed to
				fall over onto his knees in pain. Despite all his experience over
				Mikumo, the teen realized that he had a higher resistance to their quirk
				drawback as he fell from the man&rsquo;s grasp.
			</p>

			<p>
				Another strike of pain rocked both of them as the sky above seemed to
				shatter. The last thing Mikumo felt before the darkness after blinding
				light was falling beneath the surface of the water once more as the
				black hole overhead chimed in time with his heartbeat. A kaleidoscope of
				color circled his event horizon.
			</p>

				Katsuki watched as the nerd tackled All for One. He held his breath as
				black and crimson and turquoise wrapped around and fought each other in
				the air as both <em>All for One</em> holders held a palm on each other's
				face. Elf had scrambled away from them a second after Mikumo&rsquo;s
				arrival.
			</p>

			<p>
				No one moved for several seconds afterward, at least, not until All for
				One slowly smiled as the energy in the air seemed to <em>scream</em>.
				Katsuki had enough and charged at the fucker. A precise explosion aimed
				right for the man&rsquo;s throat rather than his face to not
				accidentally burn Izu- Mikumo. Both seemed to wince at the attack.
			</p>

			<p>
				Before he could relay that the attack seemed to hurt both of them,
				Exhibitionist ran in with his own supercharged punch. The shockwave
				knocked Katsuki back as All for One was launched down the street once
				more. Twin screams of raw pain rose up from the white haired men as they
				were separated.
			</p>

			<p>
				He ran for where Mikumo had been knocked over, while the others ran
				after All for One to continue the fight while the man&rsquo;s guard was
				down. Blood dripped from Mikumo&rsquo;s nose as he shakily got to his
				feet. &ldquo;What did you do?!&rdquo; The nerd never prioritized
				himself, always jumping head first into danger for someone else.
			</p>

			<p>
				His face was slightly pale even as he smiled with a slightly deranged
				look in his tired emerald eyes, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not used to the pain
				of <em>All for One</em> like I am.&rdquo; Blue glowed around his feet
				before the nerd took off to join the others. Katsuki could only try to
				keep up, to try to make sure his brother didn&rsquo;t do something
				stupid and get hurt.
			</p>
		</div>

		<br />
		<hr />
		<br />

		<div>
			<p>
				Mikumo ignored the splitting headache as the glow of
				<em>Nyoom</em> trailed behind him, explosions signaling Kacchan&rsquo;s
				presence by his side. He felt for the new quirks, there were
				<em>so many</em>. It was a risk to try using any of them, but a few
				seemed straightforward and hopefully didn&rsquo;t have any secondary
				mutations. Perfect.
			</p>

			<p>
				Cyan and black lightning set alight around Mikumo as he tried something
				new. The cold reduced the resistance electricity experienced as it
				flowed through objects and substances, and what do you know? He recently
				acquired an ice quirk. Cold snapped through the space between Mikumo and
				All for One as <em>Taser</em> surged. An arc of lightning flashed
				through the air, following the path <em>Freeze</em> carved for it.
			</p>

			<p>
				Afterward, he slowed his pace and raised his arm to test a quirk that
				felt like wind and pressure. A burning sensation encompassed his arms as
				he forced the quirk to manifest for the first time. Mikumo waited for an
				opening as Toogata, Kirishima, and Amajiki bounced around All for One,
				attacking from all sides.
			</p>

			<p>
				He saw his chance, and fired as Kacchan continued past him. A blast of
				concentrated pressurized air struck the man like a cannon, knocking him
				back once more as a quirk shimmered like a shield in front of him. White
				star shaped eyes widened and narrowed on Mikumo. &ldquo;I will end you
				and your entire bloodline.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				Mikumo&rsquo;s response came as easily as breathing, &ldquo;Okay,
				boomer.&rdquo; Bloodlust permeated the area and well, that&rsquo;s when
				Mikumo realized he fucked up. Red lightning surged around the man as the
				pressure crackled. Lightning, ice, fire, dark energy and light, and all
				sorts of other types of emitter quirks spewed forth, all of it directed
				at Mikumo.
			</p>

			<p>
				As he teleported out of the way, dark tendrils of energy wrapped around
				All for One and slammed him into the concrete below the roof Mikumo now
				stood on. Toogata <em>flew</em> through the air at a dizzying speed as
				smoke streamed behind him. Multiple quirks. Well, that certainly changed
				things.
			</p>

			<p>
				Summoning his knives to his hand, Mikumo couldn&rsquo;t help but join in
				as <em>Strength, Nyoom, Taser, Freeze,</em> <em>Blink</em> and
				<em>Air Cannon</em> responded to his call. He could deal with the
				headache later.
			</p>

			<p>
				Mirio had felt the moment something <em>shifted</em> in his mind. Second
				gear came to mind as the world slowed down, or he sped up, it
				didn&rsquo;t matter. This was <em>Gearshift</em>. This was the true
				singularity. Mikumo had distracted All for One, Mirio had an opening. He
				took it.
			</p>

			<p>
				His thoughts sped along at a pace he couldn&rsquo;t make sense of, but
				still had perfect clarity of what they meant within the moment.
				<em>Danger Sense</em> pinged each attack All for One had responded with.
				He sometimes saw flashes of Mikumo at the edges of his vision as the
				older teen also danced around the Demon King, making precise strikes
				within short openings even as exhaustion clearly dragged on him.
			</p>

			<p>
				The blond doesn&rsquo;t know how much time had passed when the demon
				roared, &ldquo;Enough with this!&rdquo; The man turned to catch Mikumo
				in his grip, and the teen was too slow to evade. An explosion rocked All
				for One to the side, but he seemed to just ignore it and focused on his
				main target within his hands.
			</p>

			<p>
				A spark of light purple light flickered over Mikumo&rsquo;s shoulder
				before a massive beam of light tore through the man, making him drop
				Mikumo again in surprise. Mirio sighed in relief as shadows flickered in
				his peripheral vision once more. He channeled a portion of the stored
				energy within <em>Fa Jin</em> into his next punch, while the white eyed
				man was still staggering.
			</p>
		</div>

			<p>
				Kirishima had caught him after he teleported a little too high in the
				air while escaping All for One. &ldquo;Are you good, bro?&rdquo; He
				could already feel blood running down his arm even as
				<em>Regeneration</em> knit the gash back together. The laser quirk had
				some serious backlash, lovely.
			</p>

			<p>
				&ldquo;Yeah, just getting tired and everything hurts.&rdquo; That was
				honestly an understatement, but the others didn&rsquo;t have to know
				that. He was fine with likely being chewed out by Kacchan for his
				recklessness later.
			</p>

			<p>
				Mikumo moved to stand again, even as one leg tried to give out on him
				and the muscles around his ankles burned. The red head seemed to catch
				his nearly invisible stumble, &ldquo;Bro, just rest. I&rsquo;m sure
				Lemillion can handle the rest of the fight.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t stand just sitting back for this.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>
				A light tap to his head. &ldquo;None of that, man! Look, something we
				all had to learn earlier on was sometimes sitting back, retreating to
				fight another day, is the best way to win. Sometimes we have to lose the
				battle to win the war.&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				Mikumo leaned against a wall as he took in Kirishima&rsquo;s words.
				Sometimes you have to lose to win, huh? But what was the cost of losing?
				The cost of winning? &hellip; They already lost so much, haven't they?
				He wouldn&rsquo;t allow them to lose here.
			</p>

			<p>
				He was knocked out of his thoughts as Amajiki ran up to them, &ldquo;Hey
				that energy blast you just did, can you do it again?&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				&ldquo;Huh? Uh, I mean, maybe?&rdquo; It would hurt, but he could do it.
			</p>

			<p>
				Amajiki smiled, hope in his eyes, &ldquo;Great. I have an attack I
				normally combine with a friend, but that quirk might be a good
				substitute for hers. Just channel as much power as you can when I tell
				you to.&rdquo; The raven haired man then took several pill-like capsules
				out of his pockets and swallowed them before his arm erupted into
				scales, feathers, and fur arranged in an amalgamation of many,
				<em>many</em> different creatures. It reminded Mikumo of some of the
				more grotesque noumu that had been hidden deep within the main
				laboratory.
			</p>

			<p>
				The limbs and flesh arranged themselves into the shape of a giant barrel
				that had a similar shape to a bird&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;This is the
				Plasma Cannon. After you lend me some of that energy, I should have
				several shots with it before I need a reload. Red Riot, if you could
				help cover us, that would be great.&rdquo;
			</p>

				One moment, Katsuki had been giving the Quirk Pinata a piece of his mind
				and a taste of his quirk. The next, Exhibitionist had curled one of his
				freaky tentacles around him and pulled him away from All for One. He was
				about to yell at the bastard before a giant lilac beam blasted from down
				the street, plowing right through the demon.
			</p>

			<p>
				Well, <em>damn</em>. Okay. The white asshole managed to survive
				<em>that</em>. All for One stood as skin and muscle and
				<em>bone</em> crossed over one another as the injuries slowly,
				<em>slower than before</em>, knit together. Just like anyone else, that
				quirk bastard had limits. And he was reaching them.
			</p>

			<p>
				Red eyes looked over to where Elf had unleashed the blast as Shitty Hair
				stood nearby and Mikumo stood near the barrel holding a hand to the side
				below his waist. The nerd had his thumb and index in the shape of a
				circle, while the other three were held out straight. Katsuki
				didn&rsquo;t get what the sign meant.
			</p>

			<p>
				All for One clearly got something from it though, as the man once again
				ignored everyone else and charged right for Mikumo, <em>again</em>.
				Katsuki cursed,
				<em>what the hell did the nerd think he was doing?!</em> He only just
				got him back, why was he being so damn reckless?
			</p>
		</div>

			<p>
				Tamaki stood as he readied the next shot of Plasma Cannon. Whatever
				quirk that provided the energy for that blast was powerful. He only used
				a fraction of the energy the <em>All for One</em> user had given him,
				and it packed nearly as much of a punch as Nejire&rsquo;s at full power.
			</p>

			<p>
				Mikumo said he had a plan to lure All for One into the direct line of
				fire and to fire at full blast. He was mildly surprised when a simple
				hand gesture had managed to make the ancient evil abandon Mirio and go
				after Mikumo instead.
			</p>

			<p>
				That was also when it all went wrong. Within the blink of an eye, All
				for One&rsquo;s fingers had extended in jagged red and black as they
				stabbed right through Mikumo&rsquo;s abdomen. He heard the ancient
				evil&rsquo;s voice as he seemed to purr, &ldquo;You know, I&rsquo;ve
				been wanting to test a quirk someone had apparently tried to use to kill
				me once. I wonder if it would have. You&rsquo;re the perfect test
				subject.&rdquo; His smile only widened before uttering with venom,
				&ldquo;<em>Disappear.</em>&rdquo;
			</p>

			<p>
				He had a front row seat as Mikumo cried out in agonizing pain. Golden
				light seemed to encompass him as the surrounding air <em>cracked</em>.
				Tendrils of the gold swirled around as particles of white flaked off of
				the teen. It barely lasted a second, it felt like hours, but the sound
				of thunder boomed as Mikumo vanished in a flash of golden lightning.
			</p>

			<p>
				&ldquo;Ah, I should have just opened with that. It would have saved me
				the trouble of dealing with that nuisance.&rdquo; Bakugou slammed into
				All for One only a moment later as tears began to stream down his
				cheeks.
			</p>

			<p>
				&ldquo;How dare you! I&rsquo;ll kill you!&rdquo; The ground shook as the
				red eyed blond let loose the largest explosion Tamaki had ever seen from
				the teen. Mirio joined in with new-found fury as
				<em>Blackwhip</em> twisted in the air, before impaling through the white
				haired man in an imitation of what he had done to Mikumo.
			</p>

			<p>
				Their assault continued for seconds or minutes, he wasn&rsquo;t sure,
				still in shock over how quickly the young <em>All for One</em> user had
				been taken out when the Demon King no longer deemed to play
				<em>nice</em>. Either way, Tamaki was still present enough to see the
				signal from Mirio to fire.
			</p>

			<p>
				Unleashing the full power of what was left of Mikumo&rsquo;s quirk, even
				he was blown back in the shockwave. Buildings crumbled around them and
				the road cracked from the pressure. Nothing was left of All for One when
				the dust settled.
			</p>

			<p>
				Months had passed. Without All for One, the country was able to slowly
				start to recover under Nedzu&rsquo;s guidance. Katsuki walked along the
				ruined streets of Musutafu as an early fall chill greeted him. Tatooin
				Station was still in shambles from the fight. The fight where they
				finally won against All for One. The fight where he lost his brother. He
				continued walking.
			</p>

			<p>
				He came across the small town built within the shadow of a city, New
				Musutafu. The people there were thriving. Asking about the Tengu, they
				told him the tale of a great protector. It fit. He was tempted to tell
				them that the person they called the Tengu had helped take down the
				Demon King, but he didn&rsquo;t feel like answering questions about the
				death of his brother right now.
			</p>

			<p>
				Sunlight glistened on the surface of the water as it lapped against the
				shore of Takoba Beach. A camper sat out on the sand while plants grew in
				disarray around it. Abandoned. He had talked with Nedzu about building a
				public garden on or around Takoba. The rodent had quite liked the idea.
			</p>

			<p>
				Continuing on, he walked through the gates of a cemetery. Traveling
				across a path that he knew like the back of his own hand, he soon found
				himself in front of a grave labeled <em>Midoriya Inko</em>. This was the
				first time he came back since the fight. A cherry blossom continued to
				reach for the sky nearby, as flowers still dotted the ground.
			</p>

			<p>
				Katsuki had brought a small stone he had carved himself. It wasn&rsquo;t
				much, but it would do for now until Musutafu was rebuilt in the future.
				The name <em>Midoriya Izuku Mikumo</em> stared back at him. Maybe
				wherever his brother was, he could finally rest. Life had been hard on
				him, Katsuki hadn&rsquo;t helped.
			</p>

			<p>
				He could only be grateful the nerd loved others too much. That he had
				forgiven him in the short time they had together again. That they had
				even found each other after the all bullshit thrown at them. The shit Izuku
				had dealt with even before The Fall. He deserved all the love anyone
				could give him, and Katsuki would make sure the world knew that Midoriya
				Izuku Mikumo had been a hero in the end.
